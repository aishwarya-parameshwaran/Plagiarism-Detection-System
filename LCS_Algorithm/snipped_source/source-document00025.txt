the cross is white centered on a background of red and blue Economy Slovakia Economy - overview : Slovakia has mastered much of the difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a modern market economy . The DZURINDA government has made excellent progress in 2001-03 in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform . Major privatizations are nearly complete , the banking sector is almost completely in foreign hands , and foreign investment has picked up . Slovakia 's economy exceeded expectations in 2001-03 , despite the general European slowdown . Unemployment , at an unacceptable 15 % in 2003 , remains the economy's Achilles heel . The government faces other strong challenges in 2004 , especially the cutting of budget and current account deficits , the containment of inflation , and the strengthening of the health care system .

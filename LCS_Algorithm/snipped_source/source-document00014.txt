( _See page 6._ ) ] NITRO-EXPLOSIVES A PRACTICAL TREATISE CONCERNING THE _PROPERTIES , MANUFACTURE , AND ANALYSIS OF NITRATED SUBSTANCES , INCLUDING THE FULMINATES , SMOKELESS POWDERS , AND CELLULOID_ BY P. GERALD SANFORD , F.I.C. , F.C.S . _Public Analyst to the Borough of Penzance ; late Consulting Chemist to the Cotton Powder Company Limited ; and formerly Resident Chemist at the Stowmarket Works of the New Explosives Company Limited , and the Hayle Works of the National Explosive Company Limited_ ~Second Edition , Revised and Enlarged~ PREFACE . In compiling the following treatise , my aim has been to give a brief but thoroughly practical account of the properties , manufacture , and methods of analysis of the various nitro-explosives now so largely used for mining and blasting purposes and as propulsive agents ; and it is believed that the account given of the manufacture of nitro-glycerine and of the gelatine dynamites will be found more complete than in any similar work yet published in this country . For many of the facts and figures contained in the chapter on Smokeless Powders I am indebted to ( amongst others ) the late Mr J.D . Dougall and Messrs A.C. Ponsonby and H.M. Chapman , F.C.S . ; and for details with regard to Roburite to Messrs H.A . Krohn and W.J . Orsman , F.I.C . To these gentlemen my cordial thanks are due . Among the authorities which have been consulted in the general preparation of the work may be mentioned the _Journals_ of the Chemical Society , the Society of Chemical Industry , the United States Naval Institute , and the Royal Artillery Institution . I have also referred to several volumes of the periodical publication _Arms and Explosives ; _ to various papers by Sir Frederick Abel , Bart. , F.R.S. , and General Wardell , R.A. , on Gun-Cotton ; to `` Modern Artillery , '' by Capt . Lloyd , R.N. , and A.G. Hadcock , R.A. ; to the late Colonel Cundill's '' Dictionary of Explosives '' ; as well as to the works of Messrs Eissler , Berthelot , and others . The illustrations have been prepared chiefly from my own drawings . A few , however , have been taken ( by permission ) from the pages of _Arms and Explosives_ , or from other sources which are acknowledged in the text . P.G.S . THE LABORATORY , 20 CULLUM STREET , E.C . _May 1896._ PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION . In the preparation of the Second Edition of this work , I have chiefly made use of the current technical journals , especially of the _Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry_ . The source of my information has in every case been acknowledged . I am also indebted to several manufacturers of explosives for information respecting their special products -- among others the New Explosives Company Ltd. ; Messrs Curtis 's and Harvey Ltd. ; The Schultze Gunpowder Company Ltd. ; and Mr W.D .

CHAPTER I . _INTRODUCTORY._ The Nitro-Explosives -- Substances that have been Nitrated -- The Danger Area -- Systems of Professors Lodge , Zenger , and Melsens for the Protection of Buildings from Lightning , & c. The manufacture of the various nitro-explosives has made great advances during late years , and the various forms of nitro-compounds are gradually replacing the older forms of explosives , both for blasting purposes and also for propulsive agents , under the form of smokeless powders . The nitro-explosives belong to the so-called High Explosives , and may be defined as any chemical compound possessed of explosive properties , or capable of combining with metals to form an explosive compound , which is produced by the chemical action of nitric acid , either alone or mixed with sulphuric acid , upon any carbonaceous substance , whether such compound is mechanically mixed with other substances or not . [ A ] [ Footnote A : Definition given in Order of Council , No . 1 , Explosives Act , 1875 . ] The number of compounds and mixtures included under this definition is very large , and they are of very different chemical composition . Among the substances that have been nitrated are : -- Cellulose , under various forms , e.g. , cotton , lignin , & c. ; glycerine , benzene , starch , jute , sugar , phenol , wood , straw , and even such substances as treacle and horse-dung . Some of these are not made upon the large scale , others are but little used . Those of most importance are nitro-glycerine and nitro-cellulose . The former enters into the composition of all dynamites , and several smokeless powders ; and the second includes gun-cotton , collodion-cotton , nitrated wood , and the majority of the smokeless powders , which consist generally of nitro-cotton , nitro-lignin , nitro-jute , & c. & c. , together with metallic nitrates , or nitro-glycerine . The nitro-explosives consist generally of some organic substance in which the NO_ { 2 } group , known as nitryl , has been substituted in place of hydrogen . Thus in glycerine , |OH C_ { 3 } H_ { 5 } |OH , |OH which is a tri-hydric alcohol , and which occurs very widely distributed as the alcoholic or basic constituent of fats , the hydrogen atoms are replaced by the NO_ { 2 } group , to form the highly explosive compound , nitro-glycerine . If one atom only is thus displaced , the mono-nitrate is formed thus , |ONO_ { 2 } C_ { 3 } H_ { 5 } |OH ; |OH and if the three atoms are displaced , C_ { 3 } H_ { 5 } ( ONO_ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } , or the tri- nitrate , is formed , which is commercial nitro-glycerine . Another class , the nitro-celluloses , are formed from cellulose , C_ { 6 } H_ { 10 } O_ { 5 } , which forms the groundwork of all vegetable tissues . Cellulose has some of the properties of the alcohols , and forms ethereal salts when treated with nitric and sulphuric acids . The hexa-nitrate , or gun-cotton , has the formula , C_ { 12 } H_ { 14 } O_ { 4 } ( ONO_ { 2 } ) _ { 6 } ; and collodion-cotton , pyroxylin , & c. , form the lower nitrates , i.e. , the tetra- and penta-nitrates . These last are soluble in various solvents , such as ether-alcohol and nitro-glycerine , in which the hexa-nitrate is insoluble . They all dissolve , however , in acetone and acetic ether . The solution of the soluble varieties in ether-alcohol is known as collodion , which finds many applications in the arts . The hydrocarbon benzene , C_ { 6 } H_ { 6 } , prepared from the light oil obtained from coal-tar , when nitrated forms nitro-benzenes , such as mono-nitro-benzene , C_ { 6 } H_ { 5 } NO_ { 2 } , and di-nitro-benzene , C_ { 6 } H_ { 4 } ( NO_ { 2 } ) _ { 2 } , in which one and two atoms are replaced by the NO_ { 2 } group . The latter of these compounds is used as an explosive , and enters into the composition of such well-known explosives as roburite , & c. The presence of nitro groups in a substance increases the difficulty of further nitration , and in any case not more than three nitro groups can be introduced into an aromatic compound , or the phenols . All aromatic compounds with the general formula , C_ { 6 } H_ { 4 } X_ { 2 } , give , however , three series . They are called ortho , meta , or para compounds , depending upon the position of NO_ { 2 } groups introduced . Certain regularities have been observed in the formation of nitro- compounds . If , for example , a substance contains alkyl or hydroxyl groups , large quantities of the para compound are obtained , and very little of the ortho . The substitution takes place , however , almost entirely in the meta position , if a nitro , carboxyl , or aldehyde group be present . Ordinary phenol , C_ { 6 } H_ { 5 } .OH , gives para- and ortho-nitro-phenol ; toluene gives para- and ortho-nitro-toluene ; but nitro-benzene forms meta-di-nitro- benzene and benzoic acid , meta-nitro-benzoic acid . [ A ] [ Footnote A : `` Organic Chemistry , '' Prof. Hjelt . Translated by J.B. Tingle , Ph.D. ] If the graphic formula of benzene be represented thus ( No . 1 ) , then the positions 1 and 2 represent the ortho , 1 and 3 the meta , and 1 and 4 the para compounds . When the body phenol , C_ { 6 } H_ { 5 } .OH , is nitrated , a compound is formed known as tri-nitro-phenol , or picric acid , C_ { 6 } H_ { 2 } ( NO_ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } OH , which is used very extensively as an explosive , both as picric acid and in the form of picrates . Another nitro body that is used as an explosive is nitro-naphthalene , C_ { 10 } H_ { 6 } ( NO_ { 2 } ) _ { 2 } , in roburite , securite , and other explosives of this class . The hexa-nitro- mannite , C_ { 6 } H_ { 8 } ( ONO_ { 2 } ) _ { 6 } , is formed [ Illustration : No

None of these cable , with the exception of the new Atlantic , were tested under water after manufacture , and every one of them was covered with a sheathing of light iron wire , weighing in the aggregate only about fifteen hundred pounds per mile . These two peculiarities are sufficient to account for every failure which has occurred , with the exception of the new Atlantic . No electrical test will show the presence of flaws in the insulating cover of a wire , unless water , or some other conductor , enters the flaws and establishes an electrical connection between the outside and inside of the cable . All cables now manufactured are tested under water before being laid . * * * * * Communication between the Ottoman capital and Western Europe passes through Vienna . From this city to Constantinople there are two distinct lines , -- one passing by Semlin and Belgrade to Adrianople , the other by Toultcha , Kustendji , and Varna . There is a third line to Adrianople by Bucharest ; and by the opening of the submarine line between Avlona and Otranto , in Italy , the Turkish telegraph service will be in direct communication with the West , without going through Servia or the Moldo-Wallachian Principalities . Communication between Constantinople and India is maintained over the following route : -- To Ismid , 55 miles ; thence to Mudurli , 104 miles ; thence to Angora , 111 miles ; thence to Guzgat , 113 miles ; thence to Sivas , 140 miles ; Kharpoot , 178 miles ; Diarbekir , 77 miles ; Mardeen , 61 miles ; Djezireh , 104 miles ; Mosul , ( Nineveh , ) 91 miles ; Kerkook , 114 miles ; Bagdad , 189 miles . From Bagdad to Fao , at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab , on the Persian Gulf , is 400 miles . From Fao to Kurrachee the submarine cable stretches along the bottom of the Persian Gulf for 1,450 miles ; and thence are 500 miles of arial line across a portion of British India to Bombay . The accounts of the successful opening of this line tell of the astonishment of the savage Beloochees and Arabs along the Mekran coast at the marvel of a blue spark flashing for the Sahib to the Indus and back again in less time than it takes to smoke a hookah . At Gwadur , no sooner was the cable landed than the people of the surrounding country flocked down to hear and talk of the Feringhee witchcraft . Chiefs of the Beloochees , Muscatees , and Heratees , with their retainers , trod upon each other 's toes in their eagerness to see it work . Gwadur has given up the idea that Mahomet taught everything that could be known , and now sits upon the carpet of astonishment and chews the betel-nut of meditation . The establishment of the electric telegraph in India presented some curious as well as difficult problems . In the first place , it was discovered that the air of India is in a state of constant electrical perturbation of the strongest kind , so that the instruments there mounted went into a high fever and refused to work . Along the north and south lines a current of electricity was constantly passing , which threw the needles out of gear and baffled the signallers . Moreover , the tremendous thunder-storms ran up and down the wires and melted the conductors ; the monsoon winds tore the teak-posts out of the sodden ground ; the elephants and buffaloes trampled the fallen lines into kinks and tangles ; the Delta aborigines carried off the timber supports for fuel , and the wires or iron rods upon them to make bracelets and to supply the Hindoo smitheries ; the cotton- and rice-boats , kedging up and down the river , dragged the subaqueous wires to the surface . In addition to these graver difficulties were many of an amusing character . Wild pigs and tigers scratched their skins against the posts in the jungle , and porcupines and bandicoots burrowed them out of the ground . Kites , fishing-eagles , and hooded-crows came in hundreds and perched upon the line to see what on earth it could mean , and sometimes after a thunder-storm , when the wires were wet , were found dead by dozens , the victims of their curiosity , Monkeys climbed the posts and ran along the lines , chattering , and dropping an interfering tail from one wire to another , which tended to confound the conversations of Calcutta . Parrots , with the same contempt for electrical insulation , fastened upon one string by the beak and another by the leg ; and in one village , the complacent natives hung their fishing-lines to dry upon them . In 1856 there were four thousand miles of telegraph-wire stretched over India : some upon bamboo posts , which bent to the storms and thus defied them ; some , as in the Madras Presidency , upon monoliths of granite , -- these , during the Mutiny , proving worth ten times their cost . * * * * * Whilst the telegraph has been thus rapidly encircling the globe with its iron threads , great improvement has been made in the apparatus for transmitting the electrical signals over them . Instruments called translators , or repeaters , have been devised , by which arial lines may be operated , without repetition , over distances of many thousands of miles . Through the use of this valuable invention upon the California line , operators in New York and San Francisco are able to converse as readily and rapidly as those situated at the extremities of a line only a hundred miles in length . The enormous increase in the amount of matter to be transmitted over the wires has stimulated the inventive genius of our own country and Europe to produce an apparatus by which the capacity of a wire may be greatly increased . Mr. M. G. Farmer of Boston , Mr. J. G. Smith of Portland , Maine , Dr. Gintl of Germany , and one or two other persons , have solved the problem of the simultaneous transmission of messages over a single wire in opposite directions . But while their apparatus , with the proper arrangement of batteries , will unquestionably permit the accomplishment of this apparent paradox , the natural disturbances upon a wire of any considerable length , together with the inequalities of the current caused by escape in wet weather , have precluded its practical use . In this country , General Lefferts of New York , and in Europe , Professor Bonelli , have devoted much time and expense to the perfection of apparatus for securing greater rapidity of transmission over the arial lines . General Lefferts owns several patents covering inventions of great ingenuity and value , which are now being perfected and will shortly be brought into operation . The apparatus consists of an instrument , operated by keys similar to those of a piano-forte , for punching characters , composed of dots and lines , upon a narrow strip of paper . The paper , when thus prepared , is passed rapidly through an instrument attached to a telegraph-wire , at the other end of which is a similar instrument which runs in unison . The first instrument is provided with a flexible metallic comb , which presses through the perforations in the paper and thus closes the circuit at each dot and line , while the second instrument is provided with a metallic stylus , or pointer , which rests upon a fillet of paper prepared with chemicals , and produces , whenever the circuit is closed , dots and lines of a dark blue color upon the prepared paper . When the paper is prepared by the perforating apparatus , it can be run through the instrument at any rate of speed that is desirable , and it is estimated that with this apparatus one wire may easily perform as much work in a day as ten can under the ordinary arrangement . In Professor Bonelli 's system the dispatch is set up in printing-type , and placed on a little carriage , which is made to pass beneath a comb with five teeth , which are in communication with five arial wires of the line , at the extremity of which these same wires are joined to the five teeth of a second comb , under which passes a chemically prepared paper , carried along on a little carriage similar to the one at the other end on which the printing-type is placed . If under this arrangement the electric circuit of a battery composed of a sufficient number of elements , and distributed in a certain order , be completed , then , at the same time that the first comb is passing over the printing-type at the one end , the second comb at the other end will trace the dispatch on the prepared paper in beautiful Roman letters , and with so great a rapidity that it may be expected that five hundred messages of twenty words each will be transmitted hourly . On Wednesday , April 19th , the day of Mr. Lincoln 's funeral , eighty-five thousand words of reports were transmitted between Washington and New York , between the hours of 7 , P. M. , and 1 , A. M. , being at the rate of over fourteen thousand words per hour . Nine wires were employed for the purpose . Thirteen thousand six hundred words were transmitted by the House printing instruments on a single wire after half past seven o'clock . A telegraphic message was recently received in London from India in eight hours and a half . This message was forwarded by the Indo-European Telegraph Company , _vi_ Kurrachee and the Persian Gulf , crossing one half of Asia and the whole of Europe . During the late Rebellion in this country the telegraph was extensively employed both by the Government and the Insurgents . In the course of the past year , there have been in the service of the Government thirty field-trains , distributed as follows : -- In the Army of the Potomac , five ; in the Department of the Cumberland , five ; in the Department of the Gulf , three ; in the Department of North Carolina and Virginia , three ; in the Department of the South , two ; in the Department of the Tennessee , six ; in the Department of the Ohio , two ; at the Signal Camp of Instruction , Georgetown , D. C. , three ; at the United States Military Academy , West Point , New York , one . Of these trains , some were equipped with five , and others with ten miles of insulated wire . There were carried in the trains lances for setting up the wire , when necessary , -- reels , portable by hand , carrying wire made purposely flexible for this particular use , -- and various minor appliances , which experience has proved useful . A military organization was directed for each train . In duty of this kind , the construction of the trains , the equipment to be carried by them , and the military organization to be provided for their use , to enable them to be most rapidly and anywhere brought into action , are the subjects for study : the particular instrument to be equipped is a secondary consideration . The soldiers drilled to the duty of construction acquire in a short time a remarkable skill in the rapid extension of these lines . As was anticipated , they have proved valuable auxiliaries to the services of the corps , and have sometimes rendered them available when they would have been otherwise useless . The greatest distance at which the instruments are reported to have worked is twenty miles . The average distances at which they are used are from five to eight miles . The average speed of the most rapid construction is reported to be at the rate of a slow walk . At the first Battle of Fredericksburg field-trains were for the first time in the history of the war used on the battle-field , under the fire of the enemy 's batteries . The movements to be made on the day of that battle were of the first magnitude . The movements of the retreat were perilous to the whole army . The trains in use contributed something to the success of those movements . Many incidents are recorded of operators accompanying raiding parties into the enemy 's territory and tapping the telegraph-lines , sometimes obtaining valuable information . One is related by the `` Selma Rebel . '' The operator at that place was called to his instrument by some one up the Tennessee and Alabama Road , who desired information as to the number of the forces and supplies at Coosa Bridge . After getting all the information he could , regarding the location and strength of the Rebel forces , he informed the Selma operator that he was attached to the expedition under General Wilson , and that , at that particular time , he was stationed with his instruments up a tree near Monticello , in the hardest rain he ever saw ! Permission being given , he sent a dispatch to a young lady in Mobile , and another to a telegraph-operator in the Rebel lines , telling him he loved him as much as before the war . After some other conversation , the Yankee operator clambered down from the tree , mounted his horse , and rode away .

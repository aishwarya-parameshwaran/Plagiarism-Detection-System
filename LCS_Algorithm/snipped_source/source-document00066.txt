Book 20 Proverbs 20:001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel ; 20:001:002 To know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ; 20:001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and equity ; 20:001:004 To give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion . 20:001:005 A wise man will hear , and will increase learning ; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels : 20:001:006 To understand a proverb , and the interpretation ; the words of the wise , and their dark sayings . 20:001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction . 20:001:008 My son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother : 20:001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck . 20:001:010 My son , if sinners entice thee , consent thou not . 20:001:011 If they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause : 20:001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit : 20:001:013 We shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil : 20:001:014 Cast in thy lot among us ; let us all have one purse : 20:001:015 My son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain thy foot from their path : 20:001:016 For their feet run to evil , and make haste to shed blood . 20:001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird . 20:001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood ; they lurk privily for their own lives . 20:001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof . 20:001:020 Wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth her voice in the streets : 20:001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying , 20:001:022 How long , ye simple ones , will ye love simplicity ? and the scorners delight in their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ? 20:001:023 Turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you . 20:001:024 Because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no man regarded ; 20:001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof : 20:001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ; 20:001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you . 20:001:028 Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me : 20:001:029 For that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the LORD : 20:001:030 They would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof . 20:001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices . 20:001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them . 20:001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be quiet from fear of evil . 20:002:001 My son , if thou wilt receive my words , and hide my commandments with thee ; 20:002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply thine heart to understanding ; 20:002:003 Yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ; 20:002:004 If thou seekest her as silver , and searchest for her as for hid treasures ; 20:002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD , and find the knowledge of God . 20:002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom : out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding . 20:002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly . 20:002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of his saints . 20:002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness , and judgment , and equity ; yea , every good path . 20:002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul ; 20:002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee , understanding shall keep thee : 20:002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from the man that speaketh froward things ; 20:002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ; 20:002:014 Who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ; 20:002:015 Whose ways are crooked , and they froward in their paths : 20:002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman , even from the stranger which flattereth with her words ; 20:002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth the covenant of her God . 20:002:018 For her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead . 20:002:019 None that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the paths of life . 20:002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous . 20:002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it . 20:002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it . 20:003:001 My son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments : 20:003:002 For length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee . 20:003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind them about thy neck ; write them upon the table of thine heart : 20:003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man . 20:003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . 20:003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths . 20:003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes : fear the LORD , and depart from evil . 20:003:008 It shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones . 20:003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase : 20:003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine . 20:003:011 My son , despise not the chastening of the LORD ; neither be weary of his correction : 20:003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth . 20:003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding . 20:003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold . 20:003:015 She is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her . 20:003:016 Length of days is in her right hand ; and in her left hand riches and honour . 20:003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace . 20:003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her . 20:003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens . 20:003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew . 20:003:021 My son , let not them depart from thine eyes : keep sound wisdom and discretion : 20:003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck . 20:003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble . 20:003:024 When thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet . 20:003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh . 20:003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from being taken . 20:003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to do it . 20:003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour , Go , and come again , and to morrow I will give ; when thou hast it by thee . 20:003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour , seeing he dwelleth securely by thee . 20:003:030 Strive not with a man without cause , if he have done thee no harm . 20:003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor , and choose none of his ways . 20:003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD : but his secret is with the righteous . 20:003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just . 20:003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giveth grace unto the lowly . 20:003:035 The wise shall inherit glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fools . 20:004:001 Hear , ye children , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding . 20:004:002 For I give you good doctrine , forsake ye not my law . 20:004:003 For I was my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother . 20:004:004 He taught me also , and said unto me , Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments , and live . 20:004:005 Get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth . 20:004:006 Forsake her not , and she shall preserve thee : love her , and she shall keep thee . 20:004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy getting get understanding . 20:004:008 Exalt her , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace her . 20:004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee . 20:004:010 Hear , O my son , and receive my sayings ; and the years of thy life shall be many . 20:004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths . 20:004:012 When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble . 20:004:013 Take fast hold of instruction ; let her not go : keep her ; for she is thy life . 20:004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men . 20:004:015 Avoid it , pass not by it , turn from it , and pass away . 20:004:016 For they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall . 20:004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence . 20:004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day . 20:004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble . 20:004:020 My son , attend to my words ; incline thine ear unto my sayings . 20:004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of thine heart . 20:004:022 For they are life unto those that find them , and health to all their flesh . 20:004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of it are the issues of life . 20:004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee . 20:004:025 Let thine eyes look right on , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee . 20:004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be established . 20:004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove thy foot from evil . 20:005:001 My son , attend unto my wisdom , and bow thine ear to my understanding : 20:005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion , and that thy lips may keep knowledge . 20:005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil : 20:005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a two-edged sword . 20:005:005 Her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on hell . 20:005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are moveable , that thou canst not know them . 20:005:007 Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth . 20:005:008 Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house : 20:005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others , and thy years unto the cruel : 20:005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger ; 20:005:011 And thou mourn at the last , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed , 20:005:012 And say , How have I hated instruction , and my heart despised reproof ; 20:005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me ! 20:005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly . 20:005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well . 20:005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets . 20:005:017 Let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee . 20:005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed : and rejoice with the wife of thy youth . 20:005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love . 20:005:020 And why wilt thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ? 20:005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD , and he pondereth all his goings . 20:005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins . 20:005:023 He shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray . 20:006:001 My son , if thou be surety for thy friend , if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger , 20:006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth , thou art taken with the words of thy mouth . 20:006:003 Do this now , my son , and deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure thy friend . 20:006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids . 20:006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler . 20:006:006 Go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider her ways , and be wise : 20:006:007 Which having no guide , overseer , or ruler , 20:006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest . 20:006:009 How long wilt thou sleep , O sluggard ? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep ? 20:006:010 Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep : 20:006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as an armed man . 20:006:012 A naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth . 20:006:013 He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ; 20:006:014 Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord . 20:006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy . 20:006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate : yea , seven are an abomination unto him : 20:006:017 A proud look , a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood , 20:006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief

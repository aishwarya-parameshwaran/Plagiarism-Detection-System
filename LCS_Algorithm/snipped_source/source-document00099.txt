`` On Sunday was interred , in the burial-ground of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields , the remains of Hugh Hewson , who died at the age of 85 . The deceased was a man of no mean celebrity . He had passed more than forty years in the parish of St. Martin 's , and kept a hair-dresser 's shop , being no less a personage than the identical _Hugh Strap_ , whom Dr. Smollett rendered so conspicuously interesting in his life and adventures of Roderick Random . The deceased was a very intelligent man , and took delight in recounting the scenes of his early life . He spoke with pleasure of the time he passed in the service of the Doctor ; and it was his pride , as well as boast , to say , that he had been educated at the same seminary with so learned and distinguished a character . His shop was hung round with Latin quotations , and he would frequently point out to his acquaintance the several scenes in Roderick Random , pertaining to himself , which had their foundation , not in the Doctor 's inventive fancy , but in truth and reality . The Doctor's meeting with him at a barber 's shop at Newcastle-upon-Tyne , the subsequent mistake at the Inn , their arrival together in London , and the assistance they experienced from _Strap's_ friend were all of that description . The deceased , to the last , obtained a comfortable subsistence by his industry , and of late years had been paid a weekly salary by the inhabitants of the Adelphi , for keeping the entrances to Villiers-walk , and securing the promenade from the intrusion of strangers . '' JOHN FRANCIS . _Rodolph Gualter_ ( Vol . iii. , p . 8 . ) . -- From letters to and from Rodolph Gualter ( in _Zurich_ , and _Original Letters , Parker Society_ ) little can be gathered ; thus much have I gleaned , that though mention is oftentimes made of Scotland , yet not sufficient to identify Gualter as being a native of that country ; yet it should be observed that he dedicated his Homilies on the Galatians to the King of Scotland , _Zurich Letters_ ( second series ) cxviii. , see also , cxxix. , cxxx . These remarks may tend perchance to put J. C. R. on the right track for obtaining true information . N. E. R. ( a Subscriber . ) _Burning the Hill_ ( Vol . ii. , pp . 441 . 498 . ) . -- The provision for _burning out_ a delinquent miner , contained in the Mendip mine laws , called Lord C. J. Choke 's laws , first appeared in print in 1687 ; at least I can find no earlier notice of them in any _book_ ; but as the usages sanctioned by them are incidentally mentioned in proceedings in the Exchequer in 21 and 22 Elizabeth , they are no doubt of early date . Article 6. certainly has a very sanguinary aspect ; but as the thief , whose hut and tools are to be burnt , is himself to be `` _banished_ from his occupation before the miners for ever , '' it can not be intended that he should be himself burnt also . If any instance of the exercise of a { 124 } custom or law so clearly illegal had ever occurred within recent times , we should have assuredly found some record of it in the annals of criminal justice , as the executioner would infallibly have been hanged . The regulations are probably an attempt by some private hand to embody the local customs of the district , so far as regards lead mining ; and they contain the substance of the usual customs prevalent in most metallic regions , where mines have been worked _ab antiquo_ . The first report of the Dean Forest Commission , 1839 , f. 12. , adverts to a similar practice among the coal and iron miners in that forest . It seems to be an instance of the _Droit des arsins_ , or right of arson , formerly claimed and exercised to a considerable extent , and with great solemnity , in Picardy , Flanders , and other places ; but I know of no instance in which this wild species of metallifodine justice has been claimed to apply to anything but the culprit 's local habitation and tools of trade . I need not add that the custom , even with this limitation , would now be treated by the courts as a vulgar error , and handed over to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legal antiquaries and collectors of the Juris amoenitates . E. SMIRKE . `` _Fronte capillata_ , '' & c. ( vol . iii. , pp . 8 . 43 . ) . -- The couplet is much older than G. A. S. seems to think . The author is Dionysius Cato , -- '' Catoun , '' as Chaucer calls him -- in his book , _Distichorum de Moribus_ , lib . ii . D . xxvi . : `` Rem tibi quam nosces aptam , dimittere noli : Fronte capillata , post est Occasio calva . '' _Corp . Poet . Lat._ , Frankfurt , 1832 , p. 1195 . The history of this Dionysius Cato is unknown ; and it has been hotly disputed whether he were a Heathen or Christian ; but he is _at least_ as old as the fourth century of the Christian era , being mentioned by Vindicianus , chief physician in ordinary to the emperor , in a letter to Valentinian I. , A.D. 365 . In the illustrations of _The Baptistery_ , Parker , Oxford , 1842 , which are re-engraved from the originals in the _Via Vit Etern_ , designed by Boetius a Bolswert , the figure of `` Occasion '' is always drawn with the hair hanging loose in front , according to the distich . E. A. D. _Time when Herodotus wrote_ ( vol . ii. , p. 405. ; Vol . iii. , p . 30 . ) -- The passage in Herodotus ( i . 5 . ) is certainly curious , and had escaped my notice , until pointed out by your correspondent . I am unable at present to refer to Smith 's _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology_ ; but I doubt whether the reading of the poem or title , in Aristotle's _Rhetoric_ ( II . 9 . 1 . ) , has received much attention . In my forthcoming translation of the `` Pseudo-Herodotean Life of Homer '' prefixed to the _Odysseia_ ( Bohn 's _Classical Library_ ) , note 1. , I have thus given it : -- `` This is the exposition of the historical researches of Herodotus of _Thurium_ , '' & c. Now Aristotle makes no remark on the passage as being unusual , and it therefore inclines me to think that , at the time of that philosopher and critic , both editions were in use . The date of the building of Thurium is B.C . 444 , and Herodotus was there at its foundation , being then about forty years of age . Most likely he had published a smaller edition of this book before that time , bearing the original date from Halicarnassus , which he revised , _enlarged_ , corrected , and _partly re-wrote_ at Thurium . I think this would not be difficult to prove ; and I would add that this retouching would be found more apparent at the beginning of the volume than elsewhere . This may be easily accounted for by the feeling that modern as well as ancient authors have , viz. , that of laziness and inertness ; revising the first 100 pages carefully , but decreasing from that point . But to return : Later editors , I conceive , erased the word Thurium used by Herodotus , who was piqued and vexed at his native city , and substituted , or restored , Halicarnassus ; not , however , changing the text . A learned friend of mine wished for the bibliographical history of the classics . I told him then , as I tell the readers of the `` NOTES AND QUERIES '' now , `` Search for that history in the pages of the classics themselves ; extend to them the critical spirit that is applied to our own Chaucer , Shakspeare , and Milton , and your trouble will not be in vain . The history of any book ( that is the general history of the gradual development of its ideas ) is written in its own pages . '' In truth , the prose classics deserve as much attention as the poems of Homer . KENNETH R. H. MACKENZIE . January 20 . 1851 . _Herstmonceux Castle_ ( Vol . ii. , p . 477. ) . -- E . V. asks for an explanation of certain entries in the Fine Rolls , A.D. 1199 and 1205 , which I can , in part , supply . The first is a fine for having seisin of the lands of the deceased mother of the two suitors , William de Warburton and Ingelram de Monceaux . As they claim as joint-heirs or parceners , the land must have been subject to partibility , and therefore of socage tenure . If the land was not in Kent , the entry is a proof that the exclusive right of primogeniture was not then universally established , as we know it was not in the reign of Henry II . See _Glanville_ , lib . vii . cap . 3 . The next entry records the fine paid for suing out a writ _de rationabili parte_ against ( _versus_ ) one of the above coheirs . The demandant is either the same coheir named above , viz . Ingelram , altered by a clerical error into Waleram , -- such errors being of common occurrence , sometimes from oscitancy , and sometimes because the clerk had to guess at the extended form of a contracted name , -- or he is a descendant and heir of Ingelram , { 125 } claiming the share of his ancestor . I incline to adopt the former explanation of the two here suggested . The form of writ is in the Register of Writs , and corresponds exactly with the abridged note of it in the Fine Roll . The `` esnecia , '' mentioned in the last entry ( not extracted by E. V. ) , is the majorat or senior heir 's perquisite of the capital mansion . E. V. will pardon me for saying , that his translation of the passages is a little deficient in exactness . As to E. V. 's query 4. , does he think it worth while to go further in search of a reason for calling the bedroom floor of Herstmonceux Castle by the name of _Bethlem_ , when the early spelling and common and constant pronunciation of the word supply so plausible an explanation ? I myself knew , in my earliest days , a house where that department was constantly so nicknamed . But there certainly _may_ be a more recondite origin of the name ; and something may depend on the date at which he finds it first applied . E. SMIRKE . _Camden and Curwen Families_ ( Vol . iii. , p . 89 . ) . -- Camden 's mother was Elizabeth , daughter of Gyles Curwen , of Poulton Hall , in the county of Lancaster . In the `` visitation '' of Lancashire made in 1613 , it is stated that this Gyles Curwen was `` descended from Curwen of Workenton in co. Cumberland ; '' but the descent is not given , and I presume it rests merely on tradition . LLEWELLYN . _Joan Sanderson , or the Cushion Dance_ ( Vol . ii. , p . 517 . ) . -- Your correspondent MAC asks for the `` correct date '' of the _Cushion Dance_ . Searching out the history and origin of an old custom or ballad is like endeavouring to ascertain the source and flight of December 's snow . I am afraid MAC will not obtain what he now wishes for . The _earliest_ mention , that I have noticed , of this popular old dance occurs in Heywood 's play , _A Woman kill 'd with Kindness_ , 1600 . Nicholas , one of the characters , says : `` I have , ere now , deserved a cushion : call for the _Cushion Dance_ . '' The musical notes are preserved in _The English Dancing Master_ , 1686 ; in _The Harmonicon_ , a musical journal ; in Davies Gilbert 's _Christmas Carols_ ( 2nd edition ) ; and in Chappell 's _National English Melodies_ . In the first-named work it is called `` Joan Sanderson , or the Cushion Dance , an old Round Dance . '' In a curious collection of old songs and tunes , _Neder-Landtsche Gedenck-clank door Adrianum Valerium_ , printed at Haerlem in 1626 , is preserved a tune called `` Sweet Margaret , '' which , upon examination , proves to be the same as the _Cushion Dance_ . This favourite dance was well known in Holland in the early part of the seventeenth century , and an interesting engraving of it may be seen in the _Emblems_ of John de Brunnes , printed at Amsterdam in 1624 . The last-named work ( a copy of the edition of 1661 of which is now before me ) is exceedingly curious to the lovers of our popular sports and pastimes . The engravings are by William Pass , C. Blon , & c. , and among them are representations of Kiss in the Ring , the game of Forfeits , rolling Snow-balls , the Interior of a Barber 's Shop , with citherns and lutes hanging against the wall , for the use of the customers , & c. EDWARD F. RIMBAULT . _North Sides of Churchyards_ ( Vol . ii. , p . 93 . ) . -- In an appendix to our registers I find the following entry , where I conceive the _backside_ means the northside . Though now the whole of our churchyard is so full that we have much difficulty in finding any new ground , what we do find , however , is on the north side . `` 1750 , Oct. 23 . One Mary Davies , of Pentrobin , single woman , though excommunicated with the _Greater Excommunication_ , was on this day , _within night_ , on account of some particular circumstances alleged by neighbours of credit in her favour ( as to her resolving to come and reconcile herself , and do penance if she recovered ) , indulged by being interred on the _backside_ the church , but no service or tolling allowed . '' From this I conclude that _here_ at least there was no part of the churchyard left unconsecrated for the burial of persons excommunicate , as one of your correspondents suggests ; or burial in such place would have been no indulgence , as evidently it was regarded in this case . It would be interesting to ascertain from accredited instances _how late_ this power of excommunication has been _exercised_ , and thereby how long it has really been in abeyance . I expect the period would not be found so great as is generally imagined . WALDEGRAVE BREWSTER . _Antiquitas Sculi Juventus Mundi_ ( Vol . ii. , p . 466 . ) . -- Dugald Stewart , in his Dissertation prefixed to the _Encyclopdia Britannica_ , ed . 7. , p. 30. , points out two passages of writers anterior to Lord Bacon , in which this thought occurs . The first is in his namesake , Roger Bacon , who died in 1292 : `` Quanto juniores tanto perspicaciores , quia juniores posteriores successione temporum ingrediuntor labores priorum . '' -- _Opus Majus_ , p. 9. ed . Jebb . The _Opus Majus_ of Roger Bacon was not , however , printed until the last century , and could not have been known to Lord Bacon unless he had read it in manuscript . The second is from Ludovicus Vives , _De Caus . Corrupt . Art._ , lib . i. , of which Mr. Stewart gives the following version : -- `` The similitude which many have fancied between the superiority of the moderns to the ancients , and the elevation of a dwarf on the back of a giant , is { 126 } altogether false and puerile . Neither were they giants , nor are we dwarfs , but all of us men of the same standard ; and _we_ , the taller of the two , by adding their height to our own . Provided always that we do not yield to them in study , attention , vigilance , and love of truth ; for if these qualities be wanting , so far from mounting on the giant 's shoulders , we throw away the advantages of our own just stature , by remaining prostrate on the ground . '' Ludovicus Vives , the eminent Spanish writer , died in 1540 , and therefore preceded the active period of Lord Bacon 's mind by about half a century . Mr. Stewart likewise cites the following sentences of Seneca , which , however , can hardly be said to contain the germ of this thought : -- ``

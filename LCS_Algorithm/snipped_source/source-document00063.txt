[ Illustration : GETTING READY FOR WINTER ] PREFACE Since its first publication `` Agriculture for Beginners '' has found a welcome in thousands of schools and homes . Naturally many suggestions as to changes , additions , and other improvements have reached its authors . Naturally , too , the authors have busied themselves in devising methods to add to the effectiveness of the book . Some additions have been made almost every year since the book was published . To embody all these changes and helpful suggestions into a strictly unified volume ; to add some further topics and sections ; to bring all farm practices up to the ideals of to-day ; to include the most recent teaching of scientific investigators -- these were the objects sought in the thorough revision which has just been given the book . The authors hope and think that the remaking of the book has added to its usefulness and attractiveness . They believe now , as they believed before , that there is no line of separation between the science of agriculture and the practical art of agriculture . They are assured by the success of this book that agriculture is eminently a teachable subject . They see no difference between teaching the child the fundamental principles of farming and teaching the same child the fundamental truths of arithmetic , geography , or grammar . They hold that a youth should be trained for the farm just as carefully as he is trained for any other occupation , and that it is unreasonable to expect him to succeed without training . If they are right in these views , the training must begin in the public schools . This is true for two reasons : 1 . It is universally admitted that aptitudes are developed , tastes acquired , and life habits formed during the years that a child is in the public school . Hence , during these important years every child intended for the farm should be taught to know and love nature , should be led to form habits of observation , and should be required to begin a study of those great laws upon which agriculture is based . A training like this goes far toward making his life-work profitable and delightful . 2 . Most boys and girls reared on a farm get no educational training except that given in the public schools . If , then , the truths that unlock the doors of nature are not taught in the public schools , nature and nature 's laws will always be hid in night to a majority of our bread-winners . They must still in ignorance and hopeless drudgery tear their bread from a reluctant soil . The authors return hearty thanks to Professor Thomas F. Hunt , University of California ; Professor Augustine D. Selby , Ohio Experiment Station ; Professor W. F. Massey , horticulturist and agricultural writer ; and Professor Franklin Sherman , Jr. , State Entomologist of North Carolina , for aid in proofreading and in the preparation of some of the material .

LIFE IN THE COUNTRY 330 APPENDIX 339 GLOSSARY 342 INDEX 351 TO THE TEACHER Teachers sometimes shrink from undertaking the teaching of a simple textbook on agriculture because they are not familiar with all the processes of farming . By the same reasoning they might hesitate to teach arithmetic because they do not know calculus or to teach a primary history of the United States because they are not versed in all history . The art of farming is based on the sciences dealing with the growth of plants and animals . This book presents in a simple way these fundamental scientific truths and suggests some practices drawn from them . Hence , even though many teachers may not have plowed or sowed or harvested , such teachers need not be embarrassed in mastering and heartily instructing a class in nature 's primary laws . If teachers realize how much the efficiency , comfort , and happiness of their pupils will be increased throughout their lives from being taught to coperate with nature and to take advantage of her wonderful laws , they will eagerly begin this study . They will find also that their pupils will be actively interested in these studies bearing on their daily lives , and this interest will be carried over to other subjects . Whenever you can , take the pupils into the field , the garden , the orchard , and the dairy . Teach them to make experiments and to learn by the use of their own eyes and brains . They will , if properly led , astonish you by their efforts and growth . You will find in the practical exercises many suggestions as to experiments that you can make with your class or with individual members . Do not neglect this first-hand teaching . It will be a delight to your pupils . In many cases it will be best to finish the experiments or observational work first , and later turn to the text to amplify the pupil 's knowledge . Although the book is arranged in logical order , the teacher ought to feel free to teach any topic in the season best suited to its study . Omit any chapter or section that does not bear on your crops or does not deal with conditions in your state . The United States government and the different state experiment stations publish hundreds of bulletins on agricultural subjects . These are sent without cost , on application . It will be very helpful to get such of these bulletins as bear on the different sections of the book . These will be valuable additions to your school library . The authors would like to give a list of these bulletins bearing on each chapter , but it would soon be out of date , for the bulletins get out of print and are supplanted by newer ones . However , the United States Department of Agriculture prints a monthly list of its publications , and each state experiment station keeps a list of its bulletins . A note to the Secretary of Agriculture , Washington , D.C. , or to your own state experiment station will promptly bring you these lists , and from them you can select what you need for your school . AGRICULTURE FOR BEGINNERS CHAPTER I THE SOIL SECTION I . ORIGIN OF THE SOIL The word _soil_ occurs many times in this little book . In agriculture this word is used to describe the thin layer of surface earth that , like some great blanket , is tucked around the wrinkled and age-beaten form of our globe . The harder and colder earth under this surface layer is called the _subsoil_ . It should be noted , however , that in waterless and sun-dried regions there seems little difference between the soil and the subsoil . Plants , insects , birds , beasts , men , -- all alike are fed on what grows in this thin layer of soil . If some wild flood in sudden wrath could sweep into the ocean this earth-wrapping soil , food would soon become as scarce as it was in Samaria when mothers ate their sons . The face of the earth as we now see it , daintily robed in grass , or uplifting waving acres of corn , or even naked , water-scarred , and disfigured by man's neglect , is very different from what it was in its earliest days . How was it then ? How was the soil formed ? Learned men think that at first the surface of the earth was solid rock . How was this rock changed into workable soil ? Occasionally a curious boy picks up a rotten stone , squeezes it , and finds his hands filled with dirt , or soil . Now , just as the boy crumbled with his fingers this single stone , the great forces of nature with boundless patience crumbled , or , as it is called , disintegrated , the early rock mass . The simple but giant-strong agents that beat the rocks into powder with a clublike force a millionfold more powerful than the club force of Hercules were chiefly ( 1 ) heat and cold ; ( 2 ) water , frost , and ice ; ( 3 ) a very low form of vegetable life ; and ( 4 ) tiny animals -- if such minute bodies can be called animals . In some cases these forces acted singly ; in others , all acted together to rend and crumble the unbroken stretch of rock . Let us glance at some of the methods used by these skilled soil-makers . Heat and cold are working partners . You already know that most hot bodies shrink , or contract , on cooling . The early rocks were hot . As the outside shell of rock cooled from exposure to air and moisture it contracted . This shrinkage of the rigid rim of course broke many of the rocks , and here and there left cracks , or fissures . In these fissures water collected and froze . As freezing water expands with irresistible power , the expansion still further broke the rocks to pieces . The smaller pieces again , in the same way , were acted on by frost and ice and again crumbled . This process is still a means of soil-formation . Running water was another giant soil-former . If you would understand its action , observe some usually sparkling stream just after a washing rain . The clear waters are discolored by mud washed in from the surrounding hills . As though disliking their muddy burden , the waters strive to throw it off . Here , as low banks offer chance , they run out into shallows and drop some of it . Here , as they pass a quiet pool , they deposit more . At last they reach the still water at the mouth of the stream , and there they leave behind the last of their mud load , and often form of it little three-sided islands called _deltas_ . In the same way mighty rivers like the Amazon , the Mississippi , and the Hudson , when they are swollen by rain , bear great quantities of soil in their sweep to the seas . Some of the soil they scatter over the lowlands as they whirl seaward ; the rest they deposit in deltas at their mouths . It is estimated that the Mississippi carries to the ocean each year enough soil to cover a square mile of surface to a depth of two hundred and sixty-eight feet . [ Illustration : FIG . 1 . ROCK MARKED BY THE SCRAPING OF A GLACIER OVER IT ] The early brooks and rivers , instead of bearing mud , ran oceanward either bearing ground stone that they themselves had worn from the rocks by ceaseless fretting , or bearing stones that other forces had already dislodged . The large pieces were whirled from side to side and beaten against one another or against bedrock until they were ground into smaller and smaller pieces . The rivers distributed this rock soil just as the later rivers distribute muddy soil . For ages the moving waters ground against the rocks . Vast were the waters ; vast the number of years ; vast the results . Glaciers were another soil-producing agent . Glaciers are streams `` frozen and moving slowly but irresistibly onwards , down well-defined valleys , grinding and pulverizing the rock masses detached by the force and weight of their attack . '' Where and how were these glaciers formed ? Once a great part of upper North America was a vast sheet of ice . Whatever moisture fell from the sky fell as snow . No one knows what made this long winter of snow , but we do know that snows piled on snows until mountains of white were built up . The lower snow was by the pressure of that above it packed into ice masses . By and by some change of climate caused the masses of ice to break up somewhat and to move south and west . These moving masses , carrying rock and frozen earth , ground them to powder . King thus describes the stately movement of these snow mountains : `` Beneath the bottom of this slowly moving sheet of ice , which with more or less difficulty kept itself conformable with the face of the land over which it was riding , the sharper outstanding points were cut away and the deeper river caons filled in . Desolate and rugged rocky wastes were thrown down and spread over with rich soil . '' The joint action of air , moisture , and frost was still another agent of soil-making . This action is called _weathering_ . Whenever you have noticed the outside stones of a spring-house , you have noticed that tiny bits are crumbling from the face of the stones , and adding little by little to the soil . This is a slow way of making additions to the soil . It is estimated that it would take 728,000 years to wear away limestone rock to a depth of thirty-nine inches . But when you recall the countless years through which the weather has striven against the rocks , you can readily understand that its never-wearying activity has added immensely to the soil . In the rock soil formed in these various ways , and indeed on the rocks themselves , tiny plants that live on food taken from the air began to grow . They grew just as you now see mosses and lichens grow on the surface of rocks . The decay of these plants added some fertility to the newly formed soil . The life and death of each succeeding generation of these lowly

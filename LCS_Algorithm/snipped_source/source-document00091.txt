A. Lincoln ] WILLIAM H. TOWNSEND A MAN OF THE PEOPLE A DRAMA OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN BY THOMAS DIXON AUTHOR OF `` THE BIRTH OF A NATION , '' `` THE CLANSMAN , '' '' THE LEOPARD 'S SPOTS , '' ETC . D. APPLETON AND COMPANY NEW YORK LONDON MCMXX COPYRIGHT , 1920 , BY THOMAS DIXON PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO WILLIAM HARRIS , JR. WHOSE COURAGE AND HIGH IDEALS AS A PRODUCER GAVE TO THE AMERICAN STAGE THE EPOCH-MAKING PLAY ABRAHAM LINCOLN HISTORICAL NOTE While the popular conception of Lincoln as the Liberator of the Slave is true historically , there is a deeper view of his life and character . He was the savior , if not the real creator , of the American Union of free Democratic States . His proclamation of emancipation was purely an incident of war . The first policy of his administration was to save the Union . To this fact we owe a united Nation to-day . It is this truth of history which I try to make a living reality in my play . The scenes relating to the issues of our National life have been drawn from authentic records . The plot of the action is based on the letter of Colonel John Nicolay to Major Hay , dated August 25 , 1864 , in which the following opening paragraph is found : `` Hell is to pay . The New York politicians have got a stampede on that is about to swamp everything . Raymond and the National Committee are here to-day . R. thinks a Commission to Richmond is about the only salt to save us ; while the President sees and says it would be utter ruination . The matter is now undergoing consultation . Weak-kneed damned fools are in the movement for a new candidate to supplant the President . Everything is darkness , doubt , and discouragement . '' No liberty has been taken with an essential detail of history in the development of the action except to slightly shift the dates of two incidents for dramatic unity . In neither case does the change of date affect the validity of the scene as used . THOMAS DIXON DIVISION INTO ACTS PROLOGUE : The Lincoln cabin in the woods of Indiana , 1820 .

A MAN OF THE PEOPLE PROLOGUE PERSONS OF THE PROLOGUE ABE _A Boy of Ten._ SARAH _His Sister._ TOM LINCOLN _His Father._ NANCY _His Mother._ THE DOCTOR _An Old-fashioned Pioneer._ PROLOGUE SET SCENE : _The rough-hewn log cabin of Tom Lincoln is seen in the center surrounded by the forest wilderness of Southern Indiana , 1820._ _The cabin door is cut in level with the ground . There is no shutter to the door and no window to the cabin._ _Right and Left of the door opening are rude benches of split logs . On the walls are stretched a coon and a small bear , squirrel and muskrat skins . In the foreground on the right is seen an old-fashioned wash pot set on three stones . Near the wash pot is fixed in the ground a pole , on the top of which are hung six gourds cut for martin swallows to nest in . Beside it are a rude bench and two wash tubs . On the left is a crude settee made of a split log with legs set in augur holes and a rough back made of saplings . An old-fashioned doctor 's saddle-bags hang across the back of the settee . The trees are walnut , beech and oak -- undergrowth of dogwood , sumac and wild grapevines . These vines , festooned over the cabin , give a sinister impression . A creek winds down through the hills behind the cabin._ AT RISE : SARAH _is seen softly tiptoeing toward the cabin door . She pauses , listens and slowly peeps inside . She listens again and then slips away and calls_ . SARAH Abe ! Abe ! [ SARAH _goes back to the door and peeps in and runs to the gate._ ] Abe -- -- ! Ma 's awake now ! [ _She returns to the door , peeps in again and runs once more to the gate._ ] Abe -- -- ! He 's feelin ' her pulse ! Come on in -- do n't stay out there in the woods ... . [ ABE _enters slowly._ ] ABE What does he say ? SARAH He ai n't said nothin ' yet . ABE He 's a dumb doctor , anyhow . I could n't get him to say a word comin ' , last night . SARAH Well , he 's here now , and there 's his saddle-bags full of medicine . You 've been ridin ' all night -- you look terrible tired ! Go to bed and sleep a little -- -- ABE I ca n't -- while Ma 's so sick -- I 'm afraid to go to sleep -- -- SARAH Why -- -- ? ABE You know why -- Sarah -- -- SARAH Ah , she ai n't goin ' to die now . She 's talkin ' to the doctor -- lie down just a little while and get to sleep before the sun comes up or ye ca n't sleep -- -- [ _Pleading._ ] -- come on -- -- ABE No -- I 'm scared -- the plague 's killin ' folks every day -- and nobody knows what to do for 'em -- -- [ _The_ DOCTOR _and_ TOM _enter from the cabin and come down slowly -- the_ DOCTOR _seems to be debating his course of action._ ] [ _Eagerly to_ DOCTOR . ] You can do somethin ' for her , Doctor ? DOCTOR [ _Hesitates._ ] Yes -- Get me a clean towel and a bowl -- -- ABE Run , SARAH -- quick -- -- SARAH [ _Running to cabin._ ] Yes -- I 'll get 'em -- -- [ _The_ DOCTOR _opens his saddle-bags , takes out his lancet and examines its keen point._ ] TOM What are ye goin ' ter do with that knife ? DOCTOR Bleed her , of course -- it 's the only thing to do -- -- [ _Starts toward cabin._ ] ABE [ _To his father._ ] Do n't let him do it -- -- ! DOCTOR What 's that ? TOM You sha n't bleed her -- I do n't know nothin ' 'bout doctorin ' -- but I know that 'll kill her -- -- DOCTOR I 've a notion to give you the worst cussin ' you ever had in your life , Tom Lincoln ... . TOM 'Twould n't do no good -- Doctor -- -- DOCTOR [ _Throwing his arms up._ ] 'Twould do _me_ good ! I 've rode all night -- thirty-five miles -- from my home in Kentucky across the Ohio , into this wilderness , just for you to insult me -- -- TOM I did n't mean to -- -- DOCTOR Well , you 're doin ' it -- and I 'd give ye the cussin ' that'ud pay me for my trouble comin ' up here -- if I had n't heard what you 've been doin ' for your neighbors , in this plague . There 's no doctor in thirty miles -- -- You 've been the doctor and nurse -- mother and father to 'em all . And when they die , you go into the woods , cut down a tree , rip out the boards , make the coffin , dig the grave and lower the dead with a prayer -- I 'd like to cuss you , Tom Lincoln -- but I ca n't -- damn ye -- -- ! TOM I 'm sorry , Doctor -- but I just could n't let ye bleed her -- -- DOCTOR All right -- good-by -- -- [ _With a snort of anger , the_ DOCTOR _throws his lancet into his saddle-bags , snaps them together , and starts for the gate._ ] ABE [ _Following the_ DOCTOR _to gate._ ] Doctor -- -- ! DOCTOR What do ye want -- -- ? ABE [ _Seizing his hand._ ] Please do n't go -- I 'm mighty sorry we made ye mad -- I did n't go to do it -- you see -- -- [ _He falters._ ] I love my Ma so , I just could n't see ye cut her arm open . And Pa didn't mean to hurt yer feelin 's -- wo n't ye stay and help us ? Ca n't ye do somethin ' else for her -- -- ? [ _Pauses._ ] I 'll pay ye -- -- ! I 'll work for ye a whole -- year -- -- DOCTOR You 'd work for me a year ? ABE [ _Eagerly._ ] I 'll work for ye _five_ years if you 'll just save her -- just save her life -- that 's all -- do n't go -- please , do n't -- -- DOCTOR [ _The_ DOCTOR _slips his arm around the boy , draws him close and holds him a moment._ ] You 're a good boy , Abe -- -- ABE You 'll stay -- -- ? DOCTOR I 'd stay and do something if I could , Sonny , but to tell ye the truth , I do n't know what to do -- I 'm not quite sure I 'm right about the bleedin ' , or I 'd stay and make you both help me -- -- [ _He pauses._ ] But I 'm not sure -- -- ! I 'm not sure ! And I do n't know what else to do -- I 've got no medicine -- so I ca n't stay . All I can tell ye is to keep her warm -- and give her everything good to eat that she can take -- she's in God 's hands -- Good-by -- -- [ _The_ DOCTOR _hurries through the gate -- and leaves_ ABE _and_ TOM _gazing forlornly after him , as_ SARAH _comes from the house._ ] SARAH I 've got the towel and bowl all ready -- -- [ _Pauses._ ] What 's the matter -- -- ? [ _Looks around._ ] Where 's the doctor -- -- ? ABE He 's gone -- -- SARAH Gone -- -- ? TOM Yes -- -- [ NANCY _enters by door of cabin._ ] [ NANCY 'S _sudden appearance in the door swings_ ABE _around with a quick cry of pain . The sun is tinging the eastern sky with the splendor of an Indian Summer morning . The mother 's figure in blue homespun suggests against the dark background of the cabin door the coming of a spirit from the unseen world . She pauses a moment in the doorway and smiles at her son._ ] ABE Oh , Ma , you must n't -- -- TOM [ _Following._ ] Nancy -- -- ! NANCY I 'm better , I 'm a lot better -- -- ABE You 're too sick to come out here , Ma -- -- NANCY [ _Smiling._ ] I can walk -- as well as you can , -- see -- -- [ _She sways slightly toward the settee._ ] ABE But the Doctor says you must keep warm -- -- NANCY Well -- I have on the warm stockings that Sarah knit for me and the coon skin moccasins you made -- do n't you see , I 'm better now -- -- ? ABE [ _Joyfully._ ] Look , Pa , she 's better ! SARAH Yes -- she 's better ! TOM [ _Alarmed._ ] Do n't try to walk -- set down , honey ! NANCY [ _Sinking on bench._ ] Yes -- I will -- -- [ _The boy comes closer , staring eagerly into his mother 's face._ ] NANCY Come closer , my boy -- -- [ ABE _kneels at her feet._ ] TOM I 'm a feared of this , Nancy -- you better let me git a hot rock and wrap it up for your feet . NANCY Yes , Tom -- and bring me the Bible . I want Abe to read to me . [ TOM _goes into the cabin worried over her._ ] ABE Feel all right , Ma -- -- ? NANCY [ _She nods and breathes deeply -- her eyes alight._ ] I wanted to see the sun rise through the trees ! You remember the day you cut down your first tree to begin the clearing and the sunlight came through the hole you 'd made to the sky -- -- ABE Yes -- I remember . NANCY You called me to come and see it -- -- ABE [ _In a whisper._ ] Yes -- -- NANCY I was proud that morning as I saw you stand with your ax on that big log -- anything my boy starts to do -- he does -- -- [ _Pauses._ ] Your father taught you to use the ax and -- -- [ _Turns and looks at_ ABE . ] Your father 's a good man , my son -- kind-hearted and true and everybody likes him . They made him road supervisor of his township in Kentucky once . If he could read and write he would have gone to the legislature -- -- [ TOM _enters from the cabin with the rock and Bible , he crosses to_ NANCY , _and_ ABE _takes the rock and puts it under her feet_ -- SARAH _kneels and helps him._ NANCY 'S _hand drops on the bench._ TOM _picks up her hand , and the chill of it worries him._ ] [ ABE _and_ SARAH _rise._ ] NANCY Read to me , son -- I like to hear your voice -- -- ABE [ _Brightly._ ] All right -- what -- -- ? NANCY The Twenty-third Psalm . [ ABE _looks for the place._ ] I love to hear you read , my boy . It means that you can do what any other man can -- it means so much ! ABE [ _Reads._ ] The Lord is my shepherd -- I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . He leadeth me beside still waters . He restoreth my soul . He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake -- -- NANCY [ _In a whisper._ ] Yea , tho ' I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for thou art with me -- -- [ ABE _stops , looks up at his mother in amazement._ ] ABE Ma -- -- NANCY Remember always , my boy , that God _is_ with you ! He is in the day and the night . He is in the sun and the wind , the trees and the grass -- and not a sparrow falls to the ground without He knows . You recollect the year you put up those gourds there -- -- [ _She points to the pole._ ] for your martins -- -- ? You cried when they circled away in the fall -- -- [ ABE _nods._ ] I told you God would send them back in the spring , did n't I -- -- ? [ _She laughs softly._ ] You said that He 'd forget to tell them and they 'd never find the way -- but they came -- did n't they -- -- ? ABE Yes , Ma , and I know now they 'll come again next spring . NANCY So -- I want you never again to doubt God , my boy , and I want you never to doubt yourself . Your bare feet , your ragged clothes , how poor you are -- this is nothing ! It does n't count here -- it 's what you feel , it's what you believe -- it 's what you see that counts ! I 've taught you to read and write , and now you can do anything ! If God takes me -- -- [ _She pauses exhausted._ ] ABE But you must n't say that , Ma -- -- ! NANCY '' The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether ! '' ABE No ! no , Ma ! Do n't talk that way ! You 'll give up if you do -- -- ! NANCY If He calls , my son , then _my_ work is done -- and _you_ can do all I 've tried and failed to do -- -- ABE [ _Alarmed._ ] Had she better talk so much , Pa -- -- [ _Stoops to fix her feet._ ] TOM [ _Feeling her hand._ ] Nancy -- -- !

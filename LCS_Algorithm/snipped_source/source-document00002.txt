Now do n't go to say I 'm the friend of force ; Best keep all your spare breath for coolin ' your broth ; And when just Law has a fair clar course , All talk of `` wild justice '' is frenzy and froth . Uncle SAM is free , but he sez , sez he : -- `` If he gits within hail Of the Glan-na-Gael , Or the _Mafia_ either , he shoots , '' sez he . This ai n't no matter for sauce or swagger -- Too summary judgment both scout , I hope ; Though _ef_ it 's a chice betwixt rope and dagger , I ca n't help sayin ' I prefer the rope . Uncle SAM is free , and he sez , sez he : -- `` At a pinch I 'll not flinch From a touch of Lynch , -- That is -- at a very _hard_ pinch ! '' sez he . But Lynch Law , UMBERTO , _or_ Secret Society , Both are bad , though the latter 's wust ; We 'll soon get shut of _either_ variety , You and me , UMBERTO , or so I trust . Uncle SAM is free , but he sez , sez he : -- `` Assassination Wo n't build a nation , Nor yet the _un_legalised rope , '' sez he . Withdraw your Ambassador ! Wal , that _air_ summary ! Italian irons so soon git hot ! Ironclads ? Sure that 's mere militant flummery . Do n't want to rile , but I 'll tell you what : Uncle SAM is free , but he sez , sez he : -- `` Let FAVA stay , Take the _Mafia_ away , And we 'll call it aright square deal ! '' sez he . * * * * * PRESENTED AT COURT. -- Acting upon the suggestions made in these columns a week ago , the Author of _The Volcano_ , and the company of the Court Theatre have effected the most valuable alterations in the play of the evening . The Second Act now concludes with the interrupted singing of _The Wolf_ , which brings down the Curtain with a roar of laughter , and the Third Act is also generally improved . Mrs. JOHN WOOD is seen at her best as the interviewing lady-journalist , which is condensing in a sentence a volume of praise . Mr. ARTHUR CECIL , as the Duke , is equally admirable ; and Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH , although scarcely in his element as a Member of Parliament of noble birth , is distinctly amusing . Altogether , _The Volcano_ causes explosions of merriment in all parts of the house , and has entirely escaped the once-impending danger of fizzling out like a damp squib . * * * * * [ Illustration : A FAIR EXCHANGE . UNCLE SAM . `` SEE HERE , UMBERTO ! -- GIVE US BACK YOUR '_MINISTER_ , ' AND TAKE AWAY THAT DARN 'D '_MAFIA_ , ' AND WE 'LL CALL IT A SQUARE DEAL ! '' ] * * * * * A COMPLAINT OF THE CENSUS . ( _BY A DISAPPOINTED DUKE._ ) [ For the first time the sixth column in the Census Schedule is simply headed `` Profession or Occupation . '' ] Oh ! I 'm a reg'lar rightdown Duke : The trying part I act and look Right nobly , so they tell me . Yet I would have you understand Why I am thoroughly unmanned At what of late befell me . A week or something less ago , A schedule came to let me know The Census Day was Sunday . The many details , one and all , Must he filled in , and then they 'd call To fetch it on the Monday . I found it easy to contrive To answer columns one to five -- I filled them up discreetly ; But when I came to column six I got into an awful fix , And lost my head completely . For `` Rank '' alas ! had disappeared . I 'd never for an instant feared It would n't really be there . Your `` Occupation '' you could state , `` Profession , '' too , you might relate , But I -- a Duke -- had neither ! His Grace the Duke of PLAZA-TOR' Would call himself , I 'm pretty sure , A `` public entertainer . '' But I and my blue-blooded wife , We lead a simple blameless life , No life could well be plainer . In such a plight what could I do ? I searched the paper through and through , Each paragraph I read . You'll Scarce credit it but those who `` live On their own means '' had got to give This statement in the schedule ! I put it , but my ducal pen I saw distinctly sputtered when I did so . All of which he Will please remember when I say I thought it in a minor way Unkind of Mr. RITCHIE ! * * * * * MICKY FREE IN PARIS . As to the incident which recently appeared in the papers under the head-line `` Insulting an Ambassador , '' our old friend MICKY writes us as follows : -- '' Be jabers then , ye must know the truth . Me and Count MUNSTER was drivin ' together . The Count 's every bit a true-born son of Ould Ireland for ever , and descended from the Kings of Munster by both sides , and more betoken was n't he wearin ' an Ulster at the very moment , and is n't he the best of chums with the Dukes of CONNAUGHT and LEINSTER ? Any way we were in our baroosh passin ' the time o ' day to one another as we were drivin ' in the Bore , when whack comes a loaf o ' bread , shied at our heads by an unknown military blaygaird . It missed me noble friend , the Count , and , as if to give him a lesson in politeness , it just took off the hat of a domestic alongside the coachman on the box . 'Tunder and turf ! ' says I , preparing to descend , and give the scoundrels a taste of my blackthorn all round . 'Whist ! be aisy now , MICKY , ' says the Ambassador to me , in what is , betune ourselves , his own native tongue ; and with that he picks up the loaf , sniffs at it , makes a wry face ( 'it 's a rye loaf , ' says I ) , and then says he , out loud , with a supercilious look , 'Ill-bred ! ' Begorra , there was a whoop o ' delight went up all round , which same was a sign of their purliteness , as divil a one of the ignoramuses could onderstand a wurrd the Court said in English or German , let alone Irish . 'Goot , ' says MUNSTER to me , dropping into his German accent , which , on occasion , comes quite natural to him -- the cratur ! 'I 'll give the loaf to the dog ; ' and he whistles up the mastiff , own brother to BISMARCK 's . 'Eh , MICKY , ye gossoon , is n't the proverb , `` Loaf me , loaf my dog '' ? ' Ah ! then was cheers for ould Ireland , and a mighty big dhrink entirely we had that same night . `` Yours as ever , M.F . '' * * * * * HERRICK UP TO DATE . ( _AFTER `` THE BRACELET TO JULIA . `` _ ) [ Illustration ] Why tye I about thy wrist , JULIA , this my silken twist ? For what other reason is't , But to show ( _in theorie_ ) Thou sweet captive art to me ; Which , of course , is fiddlededee ! Runne and aske the nearest Judge , He will tell thee 't is pure fudge ; When thou willest , _thou_ mayst trudge ; _I'm_ thy Bondslave , Hymen 's pact Bindeth me in law and fact ; Thou art free in will and act ; 'T is but silke that bindeth thee , Snap the thread , and thou art free : But 't is otherwise with me .

By the bye , telegraph people put a K to my Christian name . Tell them not to do it again . _Editor to Eminent Writer_ ( _a week later_ ) . -- Sorry about the K. Got your article . Not quite what I wanted . Style all right , but arguments idiotic . Ca n't you take the other side ? Much more popular . _Eminent Writer to Editor_. -- Idea insulting . Any more telegrams of that sort , and I contribute in future to the _Shortsprightly Review_ , not yours ! _Editor to Eminent Writer_. -- No offence meant . _Is_ there any other Review besides mine ? Never heard of the one you mentioned . _Eminent Writer to Editor_ ( _a month later_ ) . -- I say , what 's this ? Virulent personal attack on me in your Review , signed with your name ! Pretends my article on giving up Canada , & c. , was all a joke ! Am I the sort of man who would joke about anything ? Reply at once , with apology , or I skin you alive in next Number of _Shortsprightly_ . _Editor to Eminent Writer_. -- Sorry you 're offended . I thought my Article rather a moderate one . Quite true that I talk about falsehood , hypocrites , effrontery , demagogues , Pharisees , and so on ; but expressions to be taken in strictly Pickwickian sense , and of course not intended for _you_ . _Eminent Writer to Editor_. -- Explanation unsatisfactory . You first insert contribution , and then slate it . Do you call yourself an Editor ? _Editor to Eminent Writer_. -- Rather think I _do_ call myself Editor . Could n't insert that humbug about India and Canada without reply . By the bye , have forgotten if you spell Christian name with or without K ? Important . Wire back . _Eminent Writer to Editor_. -- Yah ! Look out for next _Shortsprightly_ , that 's all ! Article entitled , `` Editorial Horseplay .

I 'd always fancied thou wert so Peculiarly mine own ; No welcome doubt my soul can free ; A convict may not choose -- Yet , since another 's thou must be , Most kindly tell me _whose_ ? Is it the Lord of Shilling Thrills Who penned _The Black that Mails_ -- That martial man who from the hills Excogitates his tales ? Is it ubiquitous A. LANG ? Nay , shrink not but explain To which of all the writing gang Dost properly pertain ? Perchance to some provincial churl , Who blushes quite unseen ? Perchance to some ambitious Earl Or Stockbroker , I ween ? Such things have frequently occurred , And gems like thee have crowned The titular and moneyed herd , And made them nigh renowned . I know not , this alone is clear , Thou wert my sole delight ; I pored on thee by sunshine , dear , I dreamed of thee at night . Thou wert so good -- too splendid for The common critic 's praise -- And I was thy proprietor -- And all the world must gaze ! But _Punch_ , that autocrat , decrees That thou another 's art : I can not choose but bow my knees And lacerate my heart . Thou must be someone 's else , alack !

BORN IN 1815 . DIED 31ST MARCH , 1891 . The coarser Cyclops now combine To push the Olympians from their places ; And dead as Pan seems the old line Of greater gods and gentler graces . Pleasant , amidst the clangour crude Of smiting hammer , sounding anvil , As bland Arcadian interlude , The courtly accents of a GRANVILLE ! A strenuous time 's pedestrian muse Shouts pans to the earth-born giant , Whose brows Apollo 's wreath refuse , Whose strength to Charis is unpliant . Demos distrusts the debonair , Yet Demos found himself disarming To gracious GRANVILLE ; unaware Won by the calm , witched by the charming . Bismarckian vigour , stern and stark As Brontes self , was not his dower ; Not his to steer a storm-tost bark Through waves that whelm , and clouds that lower . Temper unstirred , unerring tact , Were his . He could not `` wave the banner , '' But he could lend to steely act The softly silken charm of manner . Kindly , accomplished , with a wit Lambent yet bland , like summer lightning ; Venomless rapier-point , whose `` hit '' Was palpable , yet painless . Brightening E'en , party conflict with a touch Of old-world grace fight could not ruffle ! Faith , GRANVILLE , we shall miss thee much Where kites and crows of faction scuffle ! * * * * * AN IRISH DIAMOND. -- The _Cork Examiner_ of 28th ultimo contained an official advertisement , signed by the High Sheriff of the County of the City of Cork , requesting certain persons connected with the Spring Assizes to attend at the Model Schools , as the Court House had been destroyed by fire .

'' Citizen-duty I 've no wish to shirk , But would the State do its own dirty work -- ( My daughters swear _'tis_ dirty ) . I 'd be grateful . Instructions ? Yes ! Imperative and fateful ! But , oh ! I wish they would `` instruct '' me how To tell the truth without a family row . `` Best of my knowledge and belief '' ! Ah well If Aunt MEHITABEL her age _won't_ tell ; If Cook will swear she 's only thirty-three , And rather fancies she was born at sea ( Where I am now ) my `` knowledge and belief '' Are not worth much to the official chief , BRIDGES P.

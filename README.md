# Plagiarism-Detection-System

#N-Gram Overlap Algorithm

The goal of this algorithm is to find whether a document has been plagiarised or not. The main motivation behind using n-gram overlap approach is that comparing n-grams is much faster and efficient rather than single word matching.

Usage:

For executing the algorithm,

Command : ngram_algorithm.py source_document_directory suspicious_train suspicious_test

2 output files are generated, output.txt and suspicious_reference.txt

For evaluating the results,

Command : output.txt suspicious_reference.txt

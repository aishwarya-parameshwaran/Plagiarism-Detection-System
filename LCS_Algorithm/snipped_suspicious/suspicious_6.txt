STUDIES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX, VOLUME II

   Sexual Inversion

by

HAVELOCK ELLIS

1927


PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.



--------------------58----------------
But it had looked
formidable only by startling contrast with the previous placidity of
the open:  it was scarcely two feet high;--it curled slowly as it
neared the beach, and combed itself out in sheets of woolly foam with a
low, rich roll of whispered thunder.  Swift in pursuit another
followed--a third--a feebler fourth; then the sea only swayed a little,
and stilled again.

So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.

She knew the facts only upon hearsay,
and only in case a misdemeanor were actually proved would it be possible
for the police to interfere as she desired. The charitable feelings of
the lady would not permit her to stop here. She made inquiries among
benevolent societies. But here again she experienced a check.

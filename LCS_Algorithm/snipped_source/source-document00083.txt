Produced by Daniel P. B. Smith PHILOSOPHY 4 A STORY OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY By Owen Wister I Two frowning boys sat in their tennis flannels beneath the glare of lamp and gas . Their leather belts were loosened , their soft pink shirts unbuttoned at the collar . They were listening with gloomy voracity to the instruction of a third . They sat at a table bared of its customary sporting ornaments , and from time to time they questioned , sucked their pencils , and scrawled vigorous , laconic notes . Their necks and faces shone with the bloom of out-of-doors . Studious concentration was evidently a painful novelty to their features . Drops of perspiration came one by one from their matted hair , and their hands dampened the paper upon which they wrote . The windows stood open wide to the May darkness , but nothing came in save heat and insects ; for spring , being behind time , was making up with a sultry burst at the end , as a delayed train makes the last few miles high above schedule speed . Thus it has been since eight o'clock . Eleven was daintily striking now . Its diminutive sonority might have belonged to some church-bell far distant across the Cambridge silence ; but it was on a shelf in the room , -- a timepiece of Gallic design , representing Mephistopheles , who caressed the world in his lap . And as the little strokes boomed , eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven , the voice of the instructor steadily continued thus : -- '' By starting from the Absolute Intelligence , the chief cravings of the reason , after unity and spirituality , receive due satisfaction . Something transcending the Objective becomes possible . In the Cogito the relation of subject and object is implied as the primary condition of all knowledge . Now , Plato never -- '' '' Skip Plato , '' interrupted one of the boys . `` You gave us his points yesterday . '' `` Yep , '' assented the other , rattling through the back pages of his notes . `` Got Plato down cold somewhere , -- oh , here . He never caught on to the subjective , any more than the other Greek bucks . Go on to the next chappie . '' `` If you gentlemen have mastered the -- the Grreek bucks , '' observed the instructor , with sleek intonation , `` we -- '' '' Yep , '' said the second tennis boy , running a rapid judicial eye over his back notes , `` you 've put us on to their curves enough . Go on . '' The instructor turned a few pages forward in the thick book of his own neat type-written notes and then resumed , -- '' The self-knowledge of matter in motion . '' `` Skip it , '' put in the first tennis boy . `` We went to those lectures ourselves , '' explained the second , whirling through another dishevelled notebook . `` Oh , yes . Hobbes and his gang . There is only one substance , matter , but it does n't strictly exist . Bodies exist . We 've got Hobbes . Go on . '' The instructor went forward a few pages more in his exhaustive volume . He had attended all the lectures but three throughout the year , taking them down in short-hand . Laryngitis had kept him from those three , to which however , he had sent a stenographic friend so that the chain was unbroken . He now took up the next philosopher on the list ; but his smooth discourse was , after a short while , rudely shaken . It was the second tennis boy questioning severely the doctrines imparted . `` So he says color is all your eye , and shape is n't ? and substance is n't ? '' `` Do you mean he claims , '' said the first boy , equally resentful , `` that if we were all extinguished the world would still be here , only there 'd be no difference between blue and pink , for instance ? '' `` The reason is clear , '' responded the tutor , blandly . He adjusted his eyeglasses , placed their elastic cord behind his ear , and referred to his notes . `` It is human sight that distinguishes between colors . If human sight be eliminated from the universe , nothing remains to make the distinction , and consequently there will be none . Thus also is it with sounds . If the universe contains no ear to hear the sound , the sound has no existence . '' `` Why ? '' said both the tennis boys at once . The tutor smiled . `` Is it not clear , '' said he , `` that there can be no sound if it is not heard ! '' `` No , '' they both returned , `` not in the least clear . '' `` It 's clear enough what he 's driving at of course , '' pursued the first boy . `` Until the waves of sound or light or what not hit us through our senses , our brains do n't experience the sensations of sound or light or what not , and so , of course , we ca n't know about them -- not until they reach us . '' `` Precisely , '' said the tutor . He had a suave and slightly alien accent . `` Well , just tell me how that proves a thunder-storm in a desert island makes no noise . '' `` If a thing is inaudible -- '' began the tutor . `` That 's mere juggling ! '' vociferated the boy , `` That 's merely the same kind of toy-shop brain-trick you gave us out of Greek philosophy yesterday . They said there was no such thing as motion because at every instant of time the moving body had to be somewhere , so how could it get anywhere else ? Good Lord ! I can make up foolishness like that myself . For instance : A moving body can never stop . Why ? Why , because at every instant of time it must be going at a certain rate , so how can it ever get slower ? Pooh ! '' He stopped . He had been gesticulating with one hand , which he now jammed wrathfully into his pocket . The tutor must have derived great pleasure from his own smile , for he prolonged and deepened and variously modified it while his shiny little calculating eyes travelled from one to the other of his ruddy scholars . He coughed , consulted his notes , and went through all the paces of superiority . `` I can find nothing about a body 's being unable to stop , '' said he , gently . `` If logic makes no appeal to you , gentlemen -- '' '' Oh , bunch ! '' exclaimed the second tennis boy , in the slang of his period , which was the early eighties . `` Look here . Color has no existence outside of our brain -- that 's the idea ? '' The tutor bowed . `` And sound has n't ? and smell has n't ? and taste has n't ? '' The tutor had repeated his little bow after each . `` And that 's because they depend on our senses ? Very well . But he claims solidity and shape and distance do exist independently of us . If we all died , they 'd he here just the same , though the others would n't . A flower would go on growing , but it would stop smelling . Very well . Now you tell me how we ascertain solidity . By the touch , do n't we ? Then , if there was nobody to touch an object , what then ? Seems to me touch is just as much of a sense as your nose is . '' ( He meant no personality , but the first boy choked a giggle as the speaker hotly followed up his thought . ) `` Seems to me by his reasoning that in a desert island there 'd be nothing it all -- smells or shapes -- not even an island . Seems to me that 's what you call logic . '' The tutor directed his smile at the open window . `` Berkeley -- '' said he . `` By Jove ! '' said the other boy , not heeding him , `` and here 's another point : if color is entirely in my brain , why do n't that ink-bottle and this shirt look alike to me ? They ought to . And why do n't a Martini cocktail and a cup of coffee taste the same to my tongue ? '' `` Berkeley , '' attempted the tutor , `` demonstrates -- '' '' Do you mean to say , '' the boy rushed on , `` that there is no eternal quality in all these things which when it meets my perceptions compels me to see differences ? '' The tutor surveyed his notes . `` I can discover no such suggestions here as you are pleased to make '' said he . `` But your orriginal researches , '' he continued most obsequiously , `` recall our next subject , -- Berkeley and the Idealists . '' And he smoothed out his notes . `` Let 's see , '' said the second boy , pondering ; `` I went to two or three lectures about that time . Berkeley -- Berkeley . Did n't he -- oh , yes ! he did . He went the whole hog . Nothing 's anywhere except in your ideas . You think the table 's there , but it is n't . There is n't any table . '' The first boy slapped his leg and lighted a cigarette . `` I remember , '' said he . `` Amounts to this : If I were to stop thinking about you , you'd evaporate . '' `` Which is balls , '' observed the second boy , judicially , again in the slang of his period , `` and can be proved so . For you 're not always thinking about me , and I 've never evaporated once . '' The first boy , after a slight wink at the second , addressed the tutor . `` Supposing you were to happen to forget yourself , '' said he to that sleek gentleman , `` would you evaporate ? '' The tutor turned his little eyes doubtfully upon the tennis boys , but answered , reciting the language of his notes : `` The idealistic theory does not apply to the thinking ego , but to the world of external phenomena . The world exists in our conception of it . `` Then , '' said the second boy , `` when a thing is inconceivable ? '' `` It has no existence , '' replied the tutor , complacently . `` But a billion dollars is inconceivable , '' retorted the boy . `` No mind can take in a sum of that size ; but it exists . '' `` Put that down ! put that down ! '' shrieked the other boy . `` You 've struck something . If we get Berkeley on the paper , I 'll run that in . '' He wrote rapidly , and then took a turn around the room , frowning as he walked . `` The actuality of a thing , '' said he , summing his clever thoughts up , '' is not disproved by its being inconceivable . Ideas alone depend upon thought for their existence . There ! Anybody can get off stuff like that by the yard . '' He picked up a cork and a foot-rule , tossed the cork , and sent it flying out of the window with the foot-rule . `` Skip Berkeley , '' said the other boy . `` How much more is there ? '' `` Necessary and accidental truths , '' answered the tutor , reading the subjects from his notes . `` Hume and the causal law . The duality , or multiplicity , of the ego . '' `` The hard-boiled ego , '' commented the boy the ruler ; and he batted a swooping June-bug into space . `` Sit down , idiot , '' said his sprightly mate . Conversation ceased . Instruction went forward . Their pencils worked . The causal law , etc. , went into their condensed notes like Liebig 's extract of beef , and drops of perspiration continued to trickle from their matted hair . II Bertie and Billy were sophomores . They had been alive for twenty years , and were young . Their tutor was also a sophomore . He too had been alive for twenty years , but never yet had become young . Bertie and Billy had colonial names ( Rogers , I think , and Schuyler ) , but the tutor 's name was Oscar Maironi , and he was charging his pupils five dollars an hour each for his instruction . Do not think this excessive . Oscar could have tutored a whole class of irresponsibles , and by that arrangement have earned probably more ; but Bertie and Billy had preempted him on account of his fame or high standing and accuracy , and they could well afford it . All three sophomores alike had happened to choose Philosophy 4 as one of their elective courses , and all alike were now face to face with the Day of Judgment . The final examinations had begun . Oscar could lay his hand upon his studious heart and await the Day of Judgment like -- I had nearly said a Christian ! His notes were full : Three hundred pages about Zeno and Parmenides and the rest , almost every word as it had come from the professor 's lips . And his memory was full , too , flowing like a player 's lines . With the right cue he could recite instantly : `` An important application of this principle , with obvious reference to Heracleitos , occurs in Aristotle , who says -- '' He could do this with the notes anywhere . I am sure you appreciate Oscar and his great power of acquiring facts . So he was ready , like the wise virgins of parable . Bertie and Billy did not put one in mind of virgins : although they had burned considerable midnight oil , it had not been to throw light upon Philosophy 4 . In them the mere word Heracleitos had raised a chill no later than yesterday , -- the chill of the unknown . They had not attended the lectures on the `` Greek bucks . '' Indeed , profiting by their privilege of voluntary recitations , they had dropped in but seldom on Philosophy 4 . These blithe grasshoppers had danced and sung away the precious storing season , and now that the bleak hour of examinations was upon them , their waked-up hearts had felt aghast at the sudden vision of their ignorance . It was on a Monday noon that this feeling came fully upon them , as they read over the names of the philosophers . Thursday was the day of the examination . `` Who 's Anaxagoras ? '' Billy had inquired of Bertie . `` I 'll tell you , '' said Bertie , `` if you 'll tell me who Epicharmos of Kos was . '' And upon this they embraced with helpless laughter . Then they reckoned up the hours left for them to learn Epicharmos of Kos in , -- between Monday noon and Thursday morning at nine , -- and their quailing chill increased . A tutor must be called in at once . So the grasshoppers , having money , sought out and quickly purchased the ant . Closeted with Oscar and his notes , they had , as Bertie put it , salted down the early Greek bucks by seven on Monday evening . By the same midnight they had , as Billy expressed it , called the turn on Plato . Tuesday was a second day of concentrated swallowing . Oscar had taken them through the thought of many centuries . There had been intermissions for lunch and dinner only ; and the weather was exceedingly hot . The pale-skinned Oscar stood this strain better than the unaccustomed Bertie and Billy . Their jovial eyes had grown hollow to-night , although their minds were going gallantly , as you have probably noticed . Their criticisms , slangy and abrupt , struck the scholastic Oscar as flippancies which he must indulge , since the pay was handsome . That these idlers should jump in with doubts and questions not contained in his sacred notes raised in him feelings betrayed just once in that remark about `` orriginal rresearch . '' `` Nine -- ten -- eleven -- twelve , '' went the little timepiece ; and Oscar rose . `` Gentlemen , '' he said , closing the sacred notes , `` we have finished the causal law . '' `` That 's the whole business except the ego racket , is n't it ? '' said Billy . `` The duality , or multiplicity

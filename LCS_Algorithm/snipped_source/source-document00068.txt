They may reach us on the best deckle-edged Whatman paper , in the newest types of famous presses , with backs of embossed vellum , with tasteful tasselled strings , -- and yet be no more to us than the constrained and uneasy acquaintances of yesterday . Friends they may become to-morrow , the day after , -- perhaps '' hunc in annum et plures '' But for the time being they have neither part nor lot in our past of retrospect and suggestion . Of what we were , of what we like or liked , they know nothing ; and we -- if that be possible -- know even less of them . Whether familiarity will breed contempt , or whether they will come home to our business and bosom , -- these are things that lie on the lap of the Fates . But it is to be observed that the associations of old books , as of new books , are not always exclusively connected with their text or format , -- are sometimes , as a matter of fact , independent of both . Often they are memorable to us by length of tenure , by propinquity , -- even by their patience under neglect . We may never read them ; and yet by reason of some wholly external and accidental characteristic , it would be a wrench to part with them if the moment of separation -- the inevitable hour -- should arrive at last . Here , to give an instance in point , is a stained and battered French folio , with patched corners , -- Mons . N. Renouard 's translation of the _Metamorphoses d'Ovide_ , 1637 , `` _enrichies de figures a chacune Fable_ '' ( very odd figures some of them are ! ) and to be bought `` _chez Pierre Billaine , rue Sainct Iacques , a la Bonne-Foy , deuant S . Yues_ . '' It has held no honoured place upon the shelves ; it has even resided au rez-de-chaussee , -- that is to say , upon the floor ; but it is not less dear , -- not less desirable . For at the back of the '' Dedication to the King '' ( Lewis XIII . to wit ) , is scrawled in a slanting , irregular hand : `` _Pour mademoiselle de mons Son tres humble et tres obeissant Serviteur St. Andre._ '' Between the fourth and fifth word , some one , in a smaller writing of later date , has added `` _par_ '' and after `` St. Andre , '' the signature `` _Vandeuvre_ . '' In these irrelevant ( and unsolicited ) interpolations , I take no interest . But who was Mlle . de Mons ? As Frederick Locker sings : Did She live yesterday or ages back ? What colour were the eyes when bright and waking ? And were your ringlets fair , or brown , or black , Poor little Head ! that long has done with aching ! [ 1 ] '' Ages back '' she certainly did _not_ live , for the book is dated `` 1637 , '' and `` yesterday '' is absurd . But that her eyes were bright , -- nay , that they were particularly lively and vivacious , even as they are in the sanguine sketches of Antoine Watteau a hundred years afterwards , I am '' confidous '' -- as Mrs. Slipslop would say . For my theory ( in reality a foregone conclusion which I shrink from dispersing by any practical resolvent ) is , that Mile . de Mons was some delightful seventeenth -- century French child , to whom the big volume had been presented as a picture-book . I can imagine the alert , strait-corseted little figure , with ribboned hair , eagerly craning across the tall folio ; and following curiously with her finger the legends under the copper `` figures , '' -- '' Narcisse en fleur , '' `` Ascalaphe en hibou , '' `` Jason endormant le dragon , '' -- and so forth , with much the same wonder that the Sinne-Beelden of Jacob Cats must have stirred in the little Dutchwomen of Middelburg . There can be no Mlle . de Mons but this , -- and for me she can never grow old ! Note : [ 1 ] This quatrain has the distinction of having been touched upon by Thackeray . When Mr. Locker 's manuscript went to the Cornhill Magazine in 1860 , it ran thus : Did she live yesterday , or ages sped ? What colour were the eyes when bright and waking ? And were your ringlets fair ? Poor little head ! -- Poor little heart ! that long has done with aching . Sometimes it comes to pass that the association is of a more far-fetched and fanciful kind . In the great Ovid it lies in an inscription : in my next case it is `` another-guess '' matter . The folio this time is the _Sylva Sylvarum_ of the `` Right Hon . Francis Lo . Verulam . Viscount St. Alban , '' of whom some people still prefer to speak as Lord Bacon . 'T is only the `` sixt Edition '' ; but it was to be bought at the Great Turk's Head , `` next to the Mytre Tauerne '' ( not the modern pretender , be it observed ! ) , which is in itself a feature of interest . A former possessor , from his notes , appears to have been largely preoccupied with that ignoble clinging to life which so exercised Matthew Arnold , for they relate chiefly to laxative simples for medicine ; and he comforts himself , in April , 1695 , by transcribing Bacon 's reflection that `` a Life led in _Religion_ and in _Holy Exercises_ '' conduces to longevity , -- an aphorism which , however useful as an argument for length of days , is a rather remote reason for religion . But what to me is always most seductive in the book is , that to this edition ( not copy , of course ) of 1651 Master Izaak Walton , when he came , in his _Compleat Angler_ of 1653 , to discuss such abstract questions as the transmission of sound under water , and the ages of carp and pike , must probably have referred . He often mentions `` Sir Francis Bacon 's '' _History of Life and Death_ , which is included in the volume . No doubt it would be more reasonable and more `` congruous '' that Bacon 's book should suggest Bacon . But there it is . That illogical `` succession of ideas '' which puzzled my Uncle Toby , invariably recalls to me , not the imposing folio to be purchased `` next to the Mytre Tauerne '' in Fleet Street , but the unpretentious eighteenpenny octavo which , two years later , was on sale at Richard Marriot 's in St. Dunstan 's churchyard hard by , and did no more than borrow its erudition from the riches of the Baconian storehouse . Life , and its prolongation , is again the theme of the next book ( also mentioned , by the way , in Walton ) which I take up , though unhappily it has no inscription . It is a little old calf-clad copy of Lewis Cornaro's _Sure and Certain Methods of attaining a Long and Healthful Life_ , 4th ed. , 24mo , 1727 ; and was bought at the Bewick sale of February , 1884 , as having once belonged to Robert Elliot Bewick , only son of the famous old Newcastle wood-engraver . As will be shown later , it is easy to be misled in these matters , but I can not help believing that this volume , which looks as if it had been re-bound , is the one Thomas Bewick mentions in his _Memoir_ as having been his companion in those speculative wanderings over the Town Moor or the Elswick Fields , when , as an apprentice , he planned his future _a la_ Franklin , and devised schemes for his conduct in life . In attaining Cornaro 's tale of years he did not succeed ; though he seems to have faithfully practised the periods of abstinence enjoined ( but probably not observed ) by another of the `` noble Venetian 's '' professed admirers , Mr. Addison of the _Spectator_ . If I have admitted a momentary misgiving as to the authenticity of the foregoing relic of the `` father of white line , '' there can be none about the next item to which I now come . Once , on a Westminster bookstall , long since disappeared , I found a copy of a seventh edition of the _Pursuits of Literature_ of T.J. Mathias , Queen Charlotte 's Treasurer's Clerk . Brutally cut down by the binder , that _durus arator_ had unexpectedly spared a solitary page for its manuscript comment , which was thoughtfully turned up and folded in . It was a note to this couplet in Mathias , his Dialogue II . : -- From Bewick 's magick wood throw borrow 'd rays O'er many a page in gorgeous Bulmer 's blaze , -- '' gorgeous Bulmer '' ( the epithet is over-coloured ! ) being the William Bulmer who , in 1795 , issued the _Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell_ . `` I '' ( says the writer of the note ) `` was chiefly instrumental to this ingenious artist 's [ Bewick 's ] excellence in this art . I first initiated his master , Mr. Ra . Beilby ( of Newcastle ) into the art , and his first essay was the execution of the cuts in my Treatise on Mensuration , printed in 4to , 1770 . Soon after I recommended the same artist to execute the cuts to Dr. Horsley 's edition of the works of Newton . Accordingly Mr. B. had the job , who put them into the hands of his assistant , Mr. Bewick , who executed them as his first work in wood , and that in a most elegant manner , tho ' spoiled in the printing by John Nichols , the Black-letter printer . C.H . 1798 . '' `` C.H . '' is Dr. Charles Hutton , the Woolwich mathematician . His note is a little in the vaunting vein of that `` founder of fortun 's , '' the excellent Uncle Pumblechook of _Great Expectations_ , for his services scarcely amounted to `` initiating '' Bewick or his master into the art of engraving on wood . Moreover , his memory must have failed him , for Bewick , and not Beilby , did the majority of the cuts to the _Mensuration_ , including a much-praised diagram of the tower of St. Nicholas Church at Newcastle , afterwards a familiar object in the younger man 's designs and tail-pieces . Be this as it may , Dr. Hutton 's note was surely worth rescuing from the ruthless binder 's plough . Between the work of Thomas Bewick and the work of Samuel Pepys , it is idle to attempt any ingenious connecting link , save the fact that they both wrote autobiographically . The `` Pepys '' in question here , however , is not the famous _Diary_ , but the Secretary to the Admiralty 's `` only other acknowledged work , '' namely , the privately printed _Memoires Relating to the State of the Royal Navy of England , for Ten Years , 1690_ ; and this copy may undoubtedly lay claim to exceptional interest . For not only does it comprise those manuscript corrections in the author's handwriting , which Dr. Tanner reproduced in his excellent Clarendon Press reprint of last year , but it includes the two portrait plates by Robert White after Kneller . The larger is bound in as a frontispiece ; the smaller ( the ex-libris ) is inserted at the beginning . The main attraction of the book to me , however , is its previous owners -- one especially . My immediate predecessor was a well-known collector , Professor Edward Solly , at whose sale in 1886 I bought it ; and he in his turn had acquired it in 1877 , at Dr. Rimbault 's sale . Probably what drew us all to the little volume was not so much its disclosure of the lamentable state of the Caroline navy , and of the monstrous toadstools that flourished so freely in the ill-ventilated holds of His Majesty's ships-of-war , as the fact that it had once belonged to that brave old philanthropist , Captain Thomas Coram of the Foundling Hospital . To him it was presented in March , 1724 , by one C. Jackson ; and he afterwards handed it on to a Mr. Mills . Pasted at the end is Coram 's autograph letter , dated `` June 10th , 1746 . '' `` To Mr. Mills These . Worthy Sir I happend to find among my few Books , Mr. Pepys his memoires , w'ch I thought might be acceptable to you & therefore pray you to accept of it . I am w'th much Respect Sir your most humble Ser't . THOMAS CORAM . '' At the Foundling Hospital is a magnificent full-length of Coram , with curling white locks and kindly , weather-beaten face , from the brush of his friend and admirer , William Hogarth . It is to Hogarth and his fellow-Governor at the Foundling , John Wilkes , that my next jotting relates . These strange colleagues in charity afterwards -- as is well known -- quarrelled bitterly over politics . Hogarth caricatured Wilkes in the _Times_ : Wilkes replied by a _North Briton_ article ( No . 17 )

Now , returning to my first intention , I say that , wishing in so far as it lies within the reach of my powers to drag from the ravening maw of time , the names of the sculptors , painters , and architects , who , from Cimabue to the present day , have been of some notable excellence in Italy , and desiring that this my labour may be no less useful than it has been pleasant to me in the undertaking , it appears to me necessary , before we come to the history , to make as briefly as may be an introduction to these three arts , wherein those were valiant of whom I am to write the Lives , to the end that every gracious spirit may first learn the most notable things in their professions , and afterwards may be able with greater pleasure and benefit to see clearly in what they were different among themselves , and how great adornment and convenience they give to their countries and to all who wish to avail themselves of their industry and knowledge . I will begin , then , with architecture , as the most universal and the most necessary and useful to men , and as that for the service and adornment of which the two others exist ; and I will expound briefly the varieties of stone , the manners or methods of construction , with their proportions , and how one may recognize buildings that are good and well-conceived . Afterwards , discoursing of sculpture , I will tell how statues are wrought , the form and the proportion that are looked for in them , and of what kind are good sculptures , with all the most secret and most necessary precepts . Finally , treating of painting , I will speak of draughtsmanship , of the methods of colouring , of the perfect execution of any work , of the quality of the pictures themselves , and of whatsoever thing appertains to painting ; of every kind of mosaic , of niello , of enamelling , of damascening , and then , lastly , of the printing of pictures . And in this way I am convinced that these my labours will delight those who are not engaged in these pursuits , and will both delight and help those who have made them a profession . For not to mention that in the Introduction they will review the methods of working , and that in the Lives of the craftsmen themselves they will learn where their works are , and how to recognize easily their perfection or imperfection and to discriminate between one manner and another , they will also be able to perceive how much praise and honour that man deserves who adds upright ways and goodness of life to the excellencies of arts so noble . Kindled by the praise that those so constituted have obtained , they too will aspire to true glory . Nor will little fruit be gathered from the history , true guide and mistress of our actions , in reading of the infinite variety of innumerable accidents that befell the craftsmen , sometimes by their own fault and very often by chance . It remains for me to make excuse for having on occasion used some words of indifferent Tuscan , whereof I do not wish to speak , having ever taken thought to use rather the words and names particular and proper to our arts than the delicate or choice words of precious writers . Let me be allowed , then , to use in their proper speech the words proper to our craftsmen , and let all content themselves with my good will , which has bestirred itself to produce this result not in order to teach to others what I do not know myself , but through a desire to preserve this memory at least of the most celebrated craftsmen , seeing that in so many decades I have not yet been able to see one who has made much record of them . For I have wished with these my rough labours , adumbrating their noble deeds , to repay to them in some measure the debt that I owe to their works , which have been to me as masters for the learning of whatsoever I know , rather than , living in sloth , to be a malignant critic of the works of others , blaming and decrying them as men are often wont to do . But it is now time to come to our business . FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 2 : The process of sgraffito work is described in Professor Baldwin Brown 's notes to `` Vasari on Technique '' as follows : `` A wall is covered with a layer of tinted plaster , and on this is superimposed a thin coating of white plaster . This outer coating is scratched through ( with an iron tool ) , and the colour behind is revealed . Then all the surface outside the design is cut away , and a cameo-like effect is given to the design . '' ] [ Footnote 3 : The process of niello is as follows : A design is engraved on silver or bronze , and the lines of the design are filled with a composition of silver and lead . On the application of fire to the whole , this composition turns black , leaving the design strongly outlined . ] PREFACE TO THE LIVES I have no manner of doubt that it is with almost all writers a common and deeply-fixed opinion that sculpture and painting together were first discovered , by the light of nature , by the people of Egypt , and that there are certain others who attribute to the Chaldans the first rough sketches in marble and the first reliefs in statuary , even as they also give to the Greeks the invention of the brush and of colouring . But I will surely say that of both one and the other of these arts the design , which is their foundation , nay rather , the very soul that conceives and nourishes within itself all the parts of man 's intellect , was already most perfect before the creation of all other things , when the Almighty God , having made the great body of the world and having adorned the heavens with their exceeding bright lights , descended lower with His intellect into the clearness of the air and the solidity of the earth , and , shaping man , discovered , together with the lovely creation of all things , the first form of sculpture ; from which man afterwards , step by step ( and this may not be denied ) , as from a true pattern , there were taken statues , sculptures , and the science of pose and of outline ; and for the first pictures ( whatsoever they were ) , softness , harmony , and the concord in discord that comes from light and shade . Thus , then , the first model whence there issued the first image of man was a lump of clay , and not without reason , seeing that the Divine Architect of time and of nature , being Himself most perfect , wished to show in the imperfection of the material the way to add and to take away ; in the same manner wherein the good sculptors and painters are wont to work , who , adding and taking away in their models , bring their imperfect sketches to that final perfection which they desire . He gave to man that most vivid colour of flesh , whence afterwards there were drawn for painting , from the mines of the earth , the colours themselves for the counterfeiting of all those things that are required for pictures . It is true , indeed , that it can not be affirmed for certain what was made by the men before the Flood in these arts in imitation of so beautiful a work , although it is reasonable to believe that they too carved and painted in every manner ; seeing that Belus , son of the proud Nimrod , about 200 years after the Flood , caused to be made that statue wherefrom there was afterwards born idolatry , and his son 's wife , the very famous Semiramis , Queen of Babylon , in the building of that city , placed among its adornments not only diverse varied kinds of animals , portrayed and coloured from nature , but also the image of herself and of Ninus , her husband , and , moreover , statues in bronze of her husband 's father , of her husband 's mother , and of the mother of the latter , as Diodorus relates , calling them by the Greek names ( that did not yet exist ) , Jove , Juno , and Ops . From these statues , perchance , the Chaldans learnt to make the images of their gods , seeing that 150 years later Rachel , in flying from Mesopotamia together with Jacob her husband , stole the idols of Laban her father , as is clearly related in Genesis . Nor , indeed , were the Chaldans alone in making sculptures and pictures , but the Egyptians made them also , exercising themselves in these arts with that so great zeal which is shown in the marvellous tomb of the most ancient King Osimandyas , copiously described by Diodorus , and proved by the stern commandment made by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt , namely , that under pain of death there should be made to God no image whatsoever . He , on descending from the mountain , having found the golden calf wrought and adored solemnly by his people , and being greatly perturbed to see Divine honours paid to the image of a beast , not only broke it and reduced it to powder , but for punishment of so great a sin caused many thousands of the wicked sons of Israel to be slain by the Levites . But because not the making of statues but their adoration was a deadly sin , we read in Exodus that the art of design and of statuary , not only in marble but in every kind of metal , was bestowed by the mouth of God on Bezaleel , of the tribe of Judah , and on Aholiab , of the tribe of Dan , who were those that made the two cherubim of gold , the candlesticks , the veil , the borders of the priestly vestments , and so many other most beautiful castings for the Tabernacle , for no other reason than to bring the people to contemplate and to adore them . From the things seen before the Flood , then , the pride of men found the way to make the statues of those for whom they wished that they should remain famous and immortal in the world . And the Greeks , who think differently about this origin , say that the Ethiopians invented the first statues , as Diodorus tells ; that the Egyptians took them from the Ethiopians , and , from them , the Greeks ; for by Homer 's time sculpture and painting are seen to have been perfected , as it is proved , in discoursing of the shield of Achilles , by that divine poet , who shows it to us carved and painted , rather than described , with every form of art . Lactantius Firmianus , by way of fable , attributes it to Prometheus , who , in the manner of Almighty God , shaped man 's image out of mud ; and from him , he declares , the art of statuary came . But according to what Pliny writes , this came to Egypt from Gyges the Lydian , who , being by the fire and gazing at his own shadow , suddenly , with some charcoal in his hand , drew his own outline on the wall . And from that age , for a time , outlines only were wont to be used , with no body of colour , as the same Pliny confirms ; which method was rediscovered with more labour by Philocles the Egyptian , and likewise by Cleanthes and Ardices of Corinth and by Telephanes of Sicyon . Cleophantes of Corinth was the first among the Greeks who used colours , and Apollodorus the first who discovered the brush . There followed Polygnotus of Thasos , Zeuxis , and Timagoras of Chalcis , with Pythias and Aglaophon , all most celebrated ; and after these the most famous Apelles , so much esteemed and honoured by Alexander the Great for his talent , and the most ingenious investigator of slander and false favour , as Lucian shows us ; even as almost all the excellent painters and sculptors were endowed by Heaven , in nearly every case , not only with the adornment of poetry , as may be read of Pacuvius , but with philosophy besides , as may be seen in Metrodorus , who , being as well versed in philosophy as in painting , was sent by the Athenians to Paulus Emilius to adorn his triumph , and remained with him to read philosophy to his sons . The art of sculpture , then , was greatly exercised in Greece , and there appeared many excellent craftsmen , and , among others , Pheidias , an Athenian , with Praxiteles and Polycletus , all very great masters , while Lysippus and Pyrgoteles were excellent in sunk reliefs , and Pygmalion in reliefs in ivory , of whom there is a fable that by his prayers he obtained breath and spirit for the figure of a virgin that he made . Painting , likewise , was honoured and rewarded by the ancient Greeks and Romans , seeing that to those who made it appear marvellous they showed favour by bestowing on them citizenship and the highest dignities . So greatly did this art flourish in Rome that Fabius gave renown to his house by writing his name under the things so beautifully painted by him in the temple of Salus , and calling himself Fabius Pictor . It was forbidden by public decree that slaves should exercise this art throughout the cities , and so much honour did the nations pay without ceasing to the art and to the craftsmen that the rarest works were sent among the triumphal spoils , as marvellous things , to Rome , and the finest craftsmen were freed from slavery and recompensed with honours and rewards by the commonwealths . The Romans themselves bore so great reverence for these arts that besides the respect that Marcellus , in sacking the city of Syracuse , commanded to be paid to a craftsman famous in them , in planning the assault of the aforesaid city they took care not to set fire to that quarter wherein there was a most beautiful painted panel , which was afterwards carried to Rome in the triumph , with much pomp . Thither , having , so to speak , despoiled the world , in course of time they assembled the craftsmen themselves as well as their finest works , wherewith afterwards Rome became so beautiful , for the reason that she gained so great adornment from the statues from abroad more than from her own native ones ; it being known that in Rhodes , the city of an island in no way large , there were more than 30,000 statues counted , either in bronze or in marble , nor did the Athenians have less , while those at Olympia and at Delphi were many more and those in Corinth numberless , and all were most beautiful and of the greatest value . Is it not known that Nicomedes , King of Lycia , in his eagerness for a Venus that was by the hand of Praxiteles , spent on it almost all the wealth of his people ? Did not Attalus the same , who , in order to possess the picture of Bacchus painted by Aristides , did not scruple to spend on it more than 6,000 sesterces ? Which picture was placed by Lucius Mummius in the temple of Ceres with the greatest pomp , in order to adorn Rome . But for all that the nobility of these arts was so highly valued , it is none the less not yet known for certain who gave them their first beginning . For , as has been already said above , it appears most ancient among the Chaldans , some give it to the Ethiopians , and the Greeks attribute it to themselves ; and it may be thought , not without reason , that it is perchance even more ancient among the Etruscans , as our Leon Batista Alberti testifies , whereof we have clear enough proof in the marvellous tomb of Porsena at Chiusi , where , no long time since , there were discovered underground , between the walls of the Labyrinth , some terracotta tiles with figures on them in half-relief , so excellent and in so beautiful a manner that it can be easily recognized that the art was not begun precisely at that time , nay rather , by reason of the perfection of these works , that it was much nearer its height than its beginning . To this , moreover , witness is likewise borne by our seeing every day many pieces

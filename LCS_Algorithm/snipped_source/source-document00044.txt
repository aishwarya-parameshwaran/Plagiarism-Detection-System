FEC Mrs. Ed Joiner [ JIM ALLEN West Point , Mississippi ] Jim Allen , West Point , age 87 , lives in a shack furnished by the city . With him lives his second wife , a much older woman . Both he and his wife have a reputation for being `` queer '' and do not welcome outside visitors . However , he readily gave an interview and seemed most willing to relate the story of his life . `` Yas , ma 'm , I 'members lots about slav'ry time , 'cause I was old 'nough . `` I was born in Russell County , Alabamy , an ' can tell you 'bout my own mammy an ' pappy an ' sisters an ' brudders . `` Mammy 's name was Darkis an ' her Marster was John Bussey , a reg'lar old drunkard , an ' my pappy 's name was John Robertson an ' b'longed to Dr. Robertson , a big farmer on Tombigbee river , five miles east of Columbus . De doctor hisself lived in Columbus . `` My sister Harriett and brudder John was fine fiel ' hands an ' Marster kep ' 'em in de fiel ' most of de time , tryin ' to dodge other white folks . `` Den dere was Sister Vice an ' brudder George . Befo ' I could 'member much , I 'members Lee King had a saloon close to Bob Allen 's store in Russell County , Alabama , and Marse John Bussey drunk my mammy up . I means by dat , Lee King tuk her an ' my brudder George fer a whiskey debt . Yes , old Marster drinked dem up . Den dey was car'ied to Florida by Sam Oneal , an ' George was jes a baby . You know , de white folks wouldn't often sep'rate de mammy an ' baby . I ai n't seen ' em since . `` Did I work ? Yes ma 'm , me an ' a girl worked in de fiel ' , carryin ' one row ; _you_ know , it tuk two chullun to mek one han ' . `` Did we have good eatins ? Yes ma 'm , old Marster fed me so good , fer I was his pet . He never 'lowed no one to pester me neither . Now dis Marster was Bob Allen who had tuk me for a whiskey debt , too . Marse Bussey could n't pay , an ' so Marse Allen tuk me , a little boy , out'n de yard whar I was playin ' marbles . De law 'lowed de fust thing de man saw , he could take . `` I served Marse Bob Allen 'til Gen'al Grant come 'long and had me an' some others to follow him to Miss'sippi . We was in de woods hidin ' de mules an ' a fine mare . Dis was after Emanc'pation , an ' Gen'al Grant was comin ' to Miss'sippi to tell de niggers dey was free . `` As I done tol ' you , I was Marse Allen 's pet nigger boy . I was called a stray . I slep ' on de flo ' by old Miss an ' Marse Bob . I could'a slep ' on de trun'le bed , but it was so easy jes to roll over an ' blow dem ashes an ' mek dat fire burn . `` Ole Miss was so good , I 'd do anything fer her . She was so good an' weighed ' round 200 poun 's . She was Marse Bob 's secon ' wife . Nobody 'posed on me , No , Sir ! I car'ied water to Marse Bob 's sto ' close by an' he would allus give me candy by de double han'full , an ' as many juice harps as I wanted . De bes ' thing I ever did eat was dat candy . Marster was good to his only stray nigger . `` Slave niggers did n't fare wid no gardens 'cept de big garden up at de Big House , when fiel ' han 's was called to wuk out hers ( old Miss ) . All de niggers had a sight of good things to eat from dat garden an ' smoke house . `` I kin see old Lady Sally now , cookin ' for us niggers , an ' Ruth cooked in de white folk 's kitchen . Ruth an ' old Man Pleas ' an ' old Lady Susan was give to Marse Bob when he mar'ied an ' come to Sandford , Alabamy . `` No , dere wa'nt no jails , but a guard house . When niggers did wrong , dey was oft'n sent dere , but mos ' allus dey was jes whupped when too lazy to wuk , an ' when dey would steal . `` Our clo'es was all wove and made on de plan'ation . Our ever'day ones , we called 'hick'ry strips . ' We had a ' plen'y er good uns . We was fitted out an ' out each season , an ' had two pairs of shoes , an ' all de snuff an ' 'bacco we wanted every month . `` No , not any weddin 's . It was kinder dis way . Dere was a good nigger man an ' a good nigger woman , an ' the Marster would say , 'I knows you both good niggers an ' I wants you to be man an ' wife dis year an ' raise little niggers ; den I wo n't have to buy ' em . ' `` Marse Bob lived in a big white house wid six rooms . He had a cou't house an ' a block whar he hired out niggers , jes like mules an ' cows . `` How many slaves did us have ? Les ' see . Dere was old Lady Sally an ' her six chullun an ' old Jake , her husban ' , de ox driver , fer de boss . Den dere was old Starlin ' , Rose , his wife an ' fo ' chullun . Some of dem was mixed blood by de oberseer . I sees 'em right now . I knowed de oberseer was nothin ' but po ' white trash , jes a tramp . Den dere was me an' Katherin . Old Lady Sally cooked for de oberseers , seven miles 'way frum de Big House . `` Ever'body was woke up at fo ' o'clock by a bugle blowed mos'ly by a nigger , an ' was at dey work by sun-up . Den dey quits at sunset . I sho' seed bad niggers whupped as many times as dere is leaves on dat groun ' . Not Marse Bob 's niggers , but our neighbors . We was called 'free , ' 'cause Marse Bob treated us so good . The whuppin ' was done by de oberseer or driver , who would say as he put de whup to de back , '_Pray sir , pray sir_ ! ' `` I seed slaves sol ' oft'ener dan you got fingers an ' toes . You know I tol ' you dere was a sellin ' block close to our sto ' . Den plen'y niggers had to be chained to a tree or post 'cause he would run 'way an ' wouldn' wuk . `` Dey would track de runways wid dogs an ' sometimes a white scal'wag or slacker wud be kotched dodgin ' duty . I seed as many deserters as I see corn stalks ober in dat fiel ' . Dey would hide out in day time an ' steal at night . `` No 'm I didn ' learn to read an ' write but my folks teached me to be honest an ' min ' Old Miss an ' Granny . Dey didn ' want us to learn how to go to de free country . `` We had a neighborhood chu'ch an bofe black an ' white went to it . Dere was a white preacher an ' sometimes a nigger preacher would sit in de pulpit wid him . De slaves set on one side of de aisle an ' white folks on de other . I allus liked preacher Williams Odem , an ' his brudder Daniel , de 'Slidin ' Elder ' . [ FN : back slider ] Dey come frum Ohio . Marse Bob Allen was head steward . I ' members lots of my fav'rite songs . Some of dem was , _Am I born to Die_ , _Alas and Did my Savior Bleed_ , an ' _Must I to de Judgment be Brought_ . The preacher would say 'Pull down de line and let de spirit be a witnes , workin ' fer faith in de future frum on high . ' `` I seed de patyrollers every week . If de niggers didn ' get a pass in han ' right frum one plan'ation to 'nother , dem patyrollers would git you . Dey would be six an ' twelve in a drove , an ' day would git you if you didn ' have dat piece of paper . No sun could go down on a pass . Dere was no trouble twixt niggers den . `` We lay down an ' res ' at night in de week time . Niggers in slav'ry time riz up in de Quarters , you could hear 'em for miles . Den da cornshucking tuk place . Den we would have singin ' . When one foun ' a red ear of corn , dey would take a drink of whiskey frum de jug an ' cup . We 'd get through' bout ten o'clock . De men did'n care if dey worked all night , fer we had the 'Heav'nly Banners ' [ FN : women and whiskey ] by us [ HW : ? ] . `` Sometimes we worked on Sat'day a'ternoon , owin ' to de crops ; but women all knocked off on Sat'day a'ternoon . On Sat'day night , we mos'ly had fun , playin ' an drinking whiskey an ' beer -- no time to fool 'roun ' in de week time . `` Some went to chu'ch an ' some went fishin ' on Sunday . On Chris'mas we had a time -- all kinds eatin ' -- wimmen got new dresses -- men tobacco -- had stuff to las ' 'til Summer . Niggers had good times in mos ' ways in slav'ry time . July 4th , we would wash up an ' have a good time . We hallowed dat day wid de white folks . Dere was a barbecue ; big table set down in bottoms . Dere was niggers strollin ' 'roun ' like ants . We was havin ' a time now . White folks too . When a slave died , dere was a to-do over dat , hollerin ' an ' singin ' . More fuss dan a little -- 'Well , sich a one has passed out an we gwine to de grave to 'tend de fun'ral ; we will talk about Sister Sallie . ' De niggers would be jumpin ' as high as a cow er mule . `` A song we used to sing was '' [ HW : Sang ] 'Come on Chariot an ' Take Her Home , Take Her Home , Here Come Chariot , les ' ride , Come on les ' ride , Come on les ' ride . ' `` Yessum we believed ha'nts would be at de grave yard . I didn ' pay no' tention to dem tho ' , for I know de evil spirit is dere . Iffen you don't believe it , let one of 'em slap you . I ai n't seed one , but I'se heard 'em . I seed someone , dey said was a ghos ' , but it got 'way quick . `` When we got sick de doctor come at once , and Mistiss was right dere to see we was cared fer . A doctor lived on our place . If you grunt he was right dere . We had castor oil an ' pills an ' turpentine an ' quinine when needful , an ' herbs was used . I can fin ' dat stuff now what we used when I was a boy . [ HW : Superstition ] '' Some of us wore brass rings on our fingers to keep off croup . Really good -- _good now_ . See mine ? `` Yessum I knows all 'bout when Yankees come . Dey got us out'er de swamp . I was layin ' down by a white oak tree 'sleep , an ' when I woke up an ' looked up an ' saw nothin ' but blue , blue , I said , 'Yonder is my Boss 's fine male hoss , Alfred . He 'tended dat horse hisself . ' He took it to heart , an ' he didn ' live long afte ' de Blue Coats took Alfred . `` Peace was declared to us fust in January in Alabamy , but not in Miss'sippi 'til Grant come back , May 8th . `` I ai n't seen my boss since dem Yankees took me 'way . I was seven miles down in de swamp when I was tuk . I wouldn ' of tol ' him goodbye . I jes wouldn ' of lef ' him . No sir , I couldn ' have lef ' my good boss . He tol' me dem Yankees was comin ' to take me off . I never wanted to see him 'cause I would have went back 'cause he pertected me an ' loved me . `` Like dis week , I lef ' de crowd . One day , Cap'in Bob McDaniel came by , an ' asked me if I wanted to mek fires an ' wuk 'round de house . I said , 'I 'd like to see de town whar you want me to go , an ' den I come to West Point . It wa'nt nothin ' but cotton rows -- lot of old shabby shanties , with jes one brick sto ' , an ' it b'longed to Ben Robertson , an ' I hope [ FN : helped ] build all de sto'es in West Point since den . `` I seed de KuKlux . We would be workin ' . Dem people would be in de fiel ' , an ' must get home 'fo dark an ' shet de door . Dey wo ' three cornered white hats with de eyes way up high . Dey skeered de breeches off'n me . First ones I got tangled up wid was right down here by de cemetery . Dey just wanted to scare you . Night riders was de same thing . I was one of de fellers what broke 'em up . `` Old man Toleson was de head leader of de Negroes . Tryin ' to get Negroes to go 'gainst our white people . I spec ' he was a two faced Yankee or carpetbagger . `` We had clubs all 'round West Point . Cap'in Shattuck out about Palo Alto said to us niggers one day , 'Stop your foolishness -- go live among your white folks an ' behave . Have sense an ' be good citizens . ' His advice was good an ' we soon broke up our clubs . `` I ai n't been to no school 'cept Sunday School since Surrender . A good white man I worked with taught me 'nough to spell 'comprestibility ' and 'compastibility . ' I had good 'membrance an ' I could have learned what white folks taught me , an ' dey sees dey manners in me . `` I mar'ied when I was turnin ' 19 , an ' my wife

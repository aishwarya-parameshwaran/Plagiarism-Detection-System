Though the hands of the King were weary , and weak his knees were grown , And he felt as a man unholpen in a waste land wending alone . THE SONS OF GIUKI Now the noon was long passed over when again the rumour arose , And through the doors cast open flowed in the river of foes : They flooded the hall of the murder

Emotion, in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure.[1][2] Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation.[3] In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.

Emotions are complex. According to some theories, they are a state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior.[2] The physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation, positive or negative.[4] According to other theories, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behavior, and physiological changes, but no one of these components is the emotion. Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components.[5]

Of Flora he thought with the regard of a brother for a sister ; of Rose with a sensation yet more deep and tender . It might be still his fate to supply the want of those guardians they had lost . Agitated by these thoughts he precipitated his journey . When he arrived in Edinburgh , where his inquiries must necessarily commence , he felt the full difficulty of his situation . Many inhabitants of that city had seen and known him as Edward Waverley ; how , then , could he avail himself of a passport as Francis Stanley ?

Emotions can be defined as a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity." Emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the survival of humans. Emotions are responses to significant internal and external events.

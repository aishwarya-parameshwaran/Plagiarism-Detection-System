Fourth Avenue , Pine Bluff , Arkansas Age : 77 '' I do n't know exactly how old I am . I was six or seven when the war ended . I member dis -- my mother said I was born on Christmas day . Old master was goin ' to war and he told her to take good care of that boy -- he was goin ' to make a fine little man . `` Did I live up to it ? I reckon I was bout as smart a man as you could jump up . The work did n't get too hard for _me_ . I farmed and I sawmilled a lot . Most of my time was farmin ' . `` I been in Jefferson County all my life . I went to school three or four sessions . `` About the war , I member dis -- I member they carried us to Camden and I saw the guards . I 'd say , 'Give me a pistol . ' They 'd say , 'Come back tomorrow and we 'll give you one . ' They had me runnin ' back there every day and I never did get one . They was Yankee soldiers . `` Our folks ' master was William E. Johnson . Oh Lord , they was just as good to us as could be to be under slavery . `` After they got free my people stayed there a year or two and then our master broke up and went back to South Carolina and the folks went in different directions . Oh Lord , my parents sho was well treated . Yes ma 'm . If he had a overseer , he would n't low him to whip the folks . He'd say , 'Just leave em till I come home . ' Then he 'd give em a light breshin ' . `` My father run off and stay in the woods one or two months . Old master say , 'Now , Jordan , why you run off ? Now I 'm goin ' to give you a light breshin ' and do n't you run off again . ' But he 'd run off again after awhile . `` He had one man named Miles Johnson just stayed in the woods so he put him on the block and sold him . `` I seed the Ku Klux . We colored folks had to make it here to Pine Bluff to the county band . If the Rebels kotch you , you was dead . `` Oh Lord yes , I voted . I voted the Publican ticket , they called it . You know they had this Australia ballot . You was sposed to go in the caboose and vote . They like to scared me to death one time . I had a description of the man I wanted to vote for in my pocket and I was lookin ' at it so I 'd be sure to vote for the right man and they caught me . They said , 'What you doin ' there ? We 're goin ' to turn you over to the sheriff after election ! ' They had me scared to death . I hid out for a long time till I seed they was n't goin ' to do nothin ' . `` My wife 's brother was one of the judges of the election . Some of the other colored folks was constables and magistrates -- some of em are now -- down in the country . `` I knew a lot about things but I knew I was in the United States and had to bow to the law . There was the compromise they give the colored folks -- half of the offices and then they got em out afterwards . John M. Clayton was runnin ' for the senate and say he goin ' to see the colored people had equal rights , but they killed him as he was gwine through the country speakin ' . `` The white people have treated me very well but they do n't pay us enough for our work -- just enough to live on and hardly that . I can say with a clear conscience that if it had n't been for this relief , I do n't know what I 'd do -- I 'm not able to work . I 'm proud that God Almighty put the spirit in the man ( Roosevelt ) to help us .

Yes ma 'm , Yes ma 'm , I would n't tell you a lie 'bout that . If I ca n't tell you the truth I 'm not goin ' tell you nothin ' ! `` Oh yes , I was a young lady in slavery times -- bred and born in Tennessee . Miss Lizzie and Marse John Williams -- I belonged to them -- sho did ! I was scared to death of the white folks . Miss Lizzie -- she mean as the devil . She would n't step her foot on the ground , she so rich . No ma 'm would n't put her foot on the ground . Have her carriage drive up to the door and have that silk carpet put down for her to walk on . Yes Lord . Would n't half feed us and they went and named me after her . `` I know all about the stars fallin ' . I was out in the field and just come in to get our dinner . Got so dark and the stars begin to play aroun ' . Mistress say , 'Lizzie , it 's the judgment . ' She was just a hollerin ' . Yes ma 'm I was a young woman . I been here a long time , yes ma 'm , I been here a long time . Worked and whipped , too . I run off many a time . Run off to see my mammy three or four miles from where I was . `` I never was sold but they took we young women and brought us down in the country to another plantation where they raised corn , wheat , and hay . Overseer whipped us too . Marse John had a brother named Marse Andrew and he was a good man . He 'd say to the overseer , 'Now do n't whip these girls so much , they ca n't work . ' Oh , he was a good man . Oh , white folks was the devil in slavery tines . I was scared to death of 'em . They 'd have these long cow hide whips . Honey , I was treated bad . I seen a time in this world . `` Oh Lord , yes , that was long 'fore the war . I was right down on my master 's place when it started . They said it was to free the niggers .

They said 'Dinah , we 're fightin ' to free you and get you out from under bondage . ' I sure understood that but I didn't have no better sense than to go back to mistress . `` Oh Lord , yes , I seed the Ku Klux . They did n't bother me cause I didn't stay where they could ; I was way under the house . `` Yankees burned up everything Marse John had . I looked up the pike and seed the Yankees a coming ' . They say 'We 's a fightin ' for you , Dinah ! ' Yankees walked in , chile , just walked right in on us . I tell you I've seed a time . You talkin ' 'bout war -- you better wish no more war come . I know when the war started . The Secessors on this side and the Yankees on that side . Yes , Miss , I seen enough . My brother went and jined the Secessors and they killed him time he got in the war . `` No , Missy , I never went to no school . White folks never learned me nothin ' . I believes in tellin ' white folks the truth . `` White folks did n't 'low us to marry so I never married till I come to Arkansas and that was one year after surrender . `` First place I landed on was John Clayton 's place . Mr. John Clayton was a Yankee and he was good to us . We worked in the field and stayed there two years . I been all up and down the river and oh Lord , I had a good time after I was free . I been treated right since I was free . My color is good to me and the white folks , too . I ai n't goin ' to tell only the truth .

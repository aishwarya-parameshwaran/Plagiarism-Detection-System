_Carr Pedigree_ ( Vol . vii. , p . 408 . ) . -- The pedigree description of Lady Carr is `` Gresil , daughter of Sir Robert Meredyth , Knt. , Chancellor of the Exchequer in Ireland . '' Sir George Carr died Feb. 13 , 1662-3 , and was buried in Dublin . His sons were 1 , Thomas , and 2 , William ; and a daughter Mary , who married 1st , Dr. Thomas Margetson ( son to the Archbishop of Armagh ) ; and 2ndly , Dr. Michael Ward . The pedigree is continued through Thomas the eldest son , who was the father of the Bishop of Killaloe . It does not appear that William left any issue . His wife 's name was Elizabeth , daughter of Edward Sing , D.D. , Lord Bishop of Cork . W. ST. _Banbury Cakes_ ( Vol . vii. , p . 106 . ) . -- In _A Treatise of Melancholy_ , by T. Bright , doctor of physic , and published in 1586 , I find the following : `` Sodden wheat is of a grosse and melancholicke nourishment , and bread especially of the fine flower unleavened : of this sort are bag-puddings or pan-puddings made with flour , frittars , pancakes , such as we call _Banberie cakes_ , and those great ones confected with butter , eggs , & c. , used at weddings ; and howsoever it be prepared , rye and bread made thereof carrieth with it plentie of melancholie . '' H. A . B . _Detached Belfry Towers_ ( Vol . vii. , pp . 333 . 416 . 465 . ) . -- To your already extensive list of church towers separate from the church , Launceston Church , Cornwall , and St. John 's Church , Chester , may not unfittingly be added . T. HUGHES . Chester . Elstow , Bedfordshire , is an instance of a bell tower separated from the body of the church . B. H. C. _Dates on Tombstones_ ( Vol . vii. , p . 331 . ) . -- A correspondent asks for instances of dates on tombstones prior to 1601 . I can not give any , but I can refer to some slabs lying upon the ground in a churchyard near Oundle ( Tausor if I remember aright ) , on which appear in relief recumbent figures with the hands upon the breast , crossed , or in the attitude of prayer . These are of a much earlier date , and I should be much pleased to know if many or any such instances elsewhere occur . B. H. C. _Subterranean Bells_ ( Vol . vii. , pp . 128 . 328 . ) . -- Bells under ground and under water , so often referred to , remind me of the Oundle Drumming Well , which I remember seeing when a child . There is a legend connected with it which I heard , but can not accurately recollect . The well itself is referred to in Brand , vol . ii . p. 369 . ( Bohn 's ed . ) , but the legend is not given . B. H. C. _Mistletoe in Ireland_ ( Vol . ii. , p . 270 . ) . -- I have just received , in full blossom , a very fine spray from a luxuriant plant of this parasite growing on an apple tree in the gardens of Farmley , the seat of William Lloyd Flood , Esq. , in the county of Kilkenny . This plant of mistletoe has existed at { 513 } Farmley beyond the memory of the present generation ; but Mr . Flood 's impression , communicated to me , is , that it was artificially produced from seed by some former gardener . If natural , which _may_ be the case , this instance of its occurrence in Ireland is , I believe , unique . JAMES GRAVES . Kilkenny . _Stars and Flowers_ ( Vol . iv. , p. 22. ; Vol . vii. , p. 151 . 341 . ) . -- Passages illustrative of this similitude have been quoted from Cowley , Longfellow , Hood , and Moir . The metaphor is also made use of by Darwin , in his _Loves of the Plants_ : `` Roll on , ye stars ! exult in youthful prime , Mark with bright curves the printless steps of time ; _Flowers of the sky ! _ ye , too , to age must yield , Frail as your silken sisters of the field . '' CUTHBERT BEDE , B.A . _The Painting by Fuseli_ ( Vol . vii. , p . 453 . ) . -- The picture by the late Henry Fuseli , R.A. , inquired after by MR. SANSOM , is in the collection at Sir John Soane 's Museum ; it was purchased by him in 1802 . It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780 , and is thus entered in the Catalogue of that year : `` No . 77 . Ezzelin Bracciaferro musing over Meduna , destroyed by him , for disloyalty , during his absence in the Holy Land . _Fuseli._ '' There is an engraving of the picture in _Essays on Physiognomy_ , by J. C. Lavater , translated from the French by Henry Hunter , D.D. , 4to . : London , 1789 . The _second_ volume , p. 294 . The inscription under that engraving , by Holloway , is as follows : `` Ezzelin , Count of Ravenna , surnamed Bracciaferro or Iron Arm , musing over the body of Meduna ; slain by him , for infidelity , during his absence in the Holy Land . '' GEORGE BAILEY . The subject of your correspondent J. SANSOM 'S inquiry is in the Soane Museum , Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Search among the Italian story-tellers will not discover the origin of the picture of Count Ezzelin 's remorse : it sprung from that fertile source of fearful images -- Henry Fuseli 's brain . The work might well have been left without a name , but for the requirements of the Royal Academy Catalogue , and , it must be added , Fuseli 's desire to mystify the Italian as well as the other scholars of his day . For confirmation of the correctness of these statements , I refer your correspondent to the _Life of Fuseli_ by Knowles , and to that by Cunningham in the _Lives of the British Painters_ . R. F. , Jun . _ '' Navita Erythrum '' _ ( Vol . vii. , p . 382 . ) . -- Since I requested a reference to these lines , I have possessed myself of a very elaborate Latin work on _Bells_ , in two vols . 8vo. , published at Rome , 1822 , by Alexander Lazzarinus , _De Vario Tintinnabulorum usu apud veteres Hebros et Ethnicos_ : wherein , in a section on the effect of the sound of bells on different animals , he quotes those very lines from `` Cornelius Kilianus Dufflus in suis poematibus . '' I shall now be thankful to be told something about the said Dufflus , -- who and what he was , -- when and where he lived ? H. T. ELLACOMBE . Rectory , Clyst St. George . * * * * * Miscellaneous . NOTES ON BOOKS , ETC . The success which has attended _The Chronological New Testament_ has encouraged the publisher of that most useful work to undertake an edition of the entire Scriptures on a similar plan ; and we have now before us the First Part of _The English Bible , containing the Old and New Testaments according to the authorised Version : newly divided into Paragraphs , with concise Introductions to the several Books ; and with Maps and Notes illustrative of the Chronology , History , and Geography of the Holy Scriptures ; containing also the most remarkable Variations of the ancient Versions , and the chief Results of modern Criticism_ . Even this ample title-page does not , however , point out the many helps towards a better understanding of the Word of God , which , by improvements in its division and typographical arrangement , are here furnished for the use of the devout student : and which has this great recommendation in our eyes , as we have no doubt it will be its greatest in that of many of our readers , that it is no endeavour to furnish a new translation , but only an attempt to turn our noble authorised version to the best account . The present Part completes the Book of Genesis , and we have little doubt that its success will be such as to secure for the publisher that patronage which will enable him to complete so desirable a work as his `` _New Edition of the authorised Version of the Bible_ . '' While on this subject , we may fitly call attention to the eighth number of _The Museum of Classical Antiquities : a Quarterly Journal of Ancient Art_ , and its accompanying _Supplement_ , both of which are entirely occupied with a question which , from its connexion with our holiest and most religious feelings , must always command our deepest attention , -- namely , the true site of Calvary , and of the Holy Sepulchre . The question is discussed at considerable length , and with great learning and acuteness ; and , we trust , from its generally interesting character , may have the effect of drawing attention to a journal which deserves the patronage of scholars to a greater extent than , from the prefatory notice , it would appear to have received up to the present time . The Second Part of _The Ulster Journal of Archology_ has just appeared . We can not better recommend it to our antiquarian friends than by pointing out that it contains the following papers : -- 1 . Metropolitan Visitation of the Diocese of Derry , A.D. 1397 . 2 . Iona . 3 . Anglo-Norman Families of Lecale , County Down . { 514 } 4 . Ogham Inscriptions . 5 . Irish Surnames , their past and present Forms . 6 . The Island of Tory in the Pagan Period . 7 . Origin and Characteristics of the People in the Counties of Down and Antrim . 8 . King William 's Progress to the Boyne . 9 . Antiquarian Notes and Queries . 10 . Annals of Ulster . We ought , in the same way , to specify the various papers to be found in the recently-published _Reports and Papers read at the Meetings of the Architectural Society of the Archdeaconry of Northampton and the Counties of York and Lincoln ; and of the Architectural and Archological Society of the County of Bedford during the Year 1852_ , -- but such a course is obviously impossible . There is one paper in the volume which , as especially worthy the attention of those interested in our Ecclesiastical History , deserves to be particularly noticed , namely , the Rev . G. A. Poole's _Synchronological Table of the Bishops of the English Sees from the Year 1050 to 1550_ . How much good service might be done to Historical Literature by the compilation and printing of many documents of a similar character ! * * * * * BOOKS AND ODD VOLUMES WANTED TO PURCHASE .

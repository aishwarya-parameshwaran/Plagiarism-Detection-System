ASTON , -- We are extremely sorry that we can not see our way to using _Red Shadows_ . The idea is an excellent one , if a trifle improbable . But you must be aware that West Africa has been worse handled by fiction-writers than any other locality , and we are afraid we dare not risk publishing a story in which the writer has drawn on his imagination for local colour , however vivid that imagination may be . The West African expert at our office assures us that _Red Shadows_ contains some inaccuracies which would be bound to spring to the eye of any reader who had been near the West Coast . We can not imperil the reputation of a magazine so widely circulated as ours , and we feel that in returning the MS. we are in some degree safeguarding your own . Thanking you for the many excellent stories you have let us have , Yours very truly , J. W. INGLEBY , Editor . II . _Aubrey Aston to the Editor._ _Laburnam Rise , Hornsey._ _May 8th._ DEAR MR. EDITOR , -- Thanks for your note . I can not help feeling that you were to some extent influenced by your knowledge of the fact that I had never been near the West Coast . I hope , however , to visit the White Man 's Grave shortly and will possibly let you have some stuff from the spot . Yours , A . A. III . _The Same to the Same._ _From Sherbro , Sierra Leone._ _June , 18th._ Mr. Aubrey Aston begs to enclose to the Editor of `` The Globe Fiction Magazine '' another West African effort , and hopes that it may pass his critic . IV . _The Editor to Aubrey Aston._ _July 31st._ DEAR MR. ASTON , -- Herewith proof of _The Case of Mr. Everett._ I trust you will be able to let us have some more West Coast tales while you are out . Stories with the true African ring about them , from such a practised pen as your own , are hard to come by . Our `` critic '' passed _Mr . Everett_ with honours . You will no doubt see yourself by now how comparatively bald and unconvincing _Red Shadows_ is , when set against a tale `` hot from the oven . '' Yours very truly , J. W. I . P.S. -- Our West African expert asks me to thank you for information on several points on which he had been hazy . It is news to him that the Mendes have an Arabic strain in their blood ; he had believed them to be pure Zishtis . He had also been in the dark as to the origin of the `` leopard '' murders . V. _From Aubrey Aston to the Editor._ _Hornsey , September 20th._ DEAR MR. EDITOR , -- Many thanks for the proof ( forwarded to me from Sierra Leone ) of _The Case of Mr. Everett_ -- which I return corrected -- and for your very gratifying note . I 'm afraid I have not yet found time to visit West Africa , but I still hope to . When I do , I will perhaps let you have some tales `` hot from the oven . '' In the meantime I find the Travel section of our local library a more comfortable and probably a more accurate source of copy . But I still have to draw on my imagination to some extent . The Mendes may be pure Yanks for all I know to the contrary ; but I hope for their own sakes they aren't Zishtis . It sounds such a horrible thing to be . As for the `` leopard '' murders , I got my information from Major Kingsley , D.S.O. , who has been a Government officer in Nigeria and Sierra Leone for fourteen years , so there may be something in it . As he is a close friend of mine I sent my story to him out there for him to look through before letting you have it , and he very kindly posted it direct to you . He has written to tell me that the ignorance shown in it was such as to preclude any possibility of improvement by revision . By the way , Major Kingsley was the author of _Red Shadows_ . He asked me as a special favour to godfather it , as he believed an unknown writer stood no chance . It is a perfectly true story . My kindest regards to your expert .

O male adult , O male adult ! This is the way we make a fairy : -- _Quicunque vult Silvis terrisque imperare_ , Think upon oaks and thorns and ashes , On glow-worms and on fire-fly flashes , On rooty loams and stony brashes ! Then upon thyme and tansy think , On fields of sainfoin , ruddy pink , On dells deep down and rocks upreared , On lad's-love and on old-man's-beard , On spearmint and on silver sages , On colewort and on saxifrages ! Then think on pools in dimmest haunts , Unwhipped of any wind that rages , Where the lithe flag her purple flaunts , Where frogs go plopping round the edge And gnats are humming through the sedge , And on the leaf of each wide lily The scaly newts do lay their eggs And the small people dip their legs To shatter the moonshine floating stilly O'er the pool 's mystic weedy dregs ! Think yet again on rolling hills Where little sleepy new-born rills Are bedded deep in upland mosses , Where tiny stars of tormentils Peer skyward with their golden gaze , Where lichened dikes and shallow fosses Are signs of far-forgotten days -- Forgotten save by us who roam Those uplands nightly after gloam , And , linking in our magic rings , Whirl in a dazzle of dancing wings -- Us only whose hot eyes beheld Fordone delights of vanished eld ! Think on it ! think on it ! And think no more on what you quit -- On hearth and home , on streets and shops , On trousers , ties , and hunting-tops -- Think no more on City dinners , On office hours and all the winners -- For you are fitted by field and dell Us to follow , with us to dwell , To be for ever free from harm , A fairy changeling by this charm , To be the lord of light and mirth , To be the lord of all the earth . * * * * * [ Illustration : ( _After ORCHARDSON 'S picture of NAPOLEON en route for St. Helena._ ) THE NEW BELLEROPHON : OR , BOTHA 'S SURPRISE PACKET .

( _With acknowledgments to various distinguished writers in this vein._ ) To me the robin is a peculiarly attractive bird . It bears itself with a sort of pompous pathos which moves me to a friendly tear and gentle laughter . * * * One came to the ledge of my parlour window the other morning , a not infrequent occurrence . `` Good morning , Robin Red-breast , '' quoth I ; and it acquiesced in an expressive silence . The conversation is generally one-sided on these occasions . `` Bird , '' I continued , `` it may interest you to know that I am writing a book . What about , you wonder ? About any old thing that happens to crop up -- yourself , for instance . '' The robin tripped hither and thither with vast self-importance . `` Not so much of it , '' said I . `` It is n't your intrinsic worth but the fact that you chanced to crop up first , that got you this publicity . '' The robin flew away in high dudgeon as Martha entered the room bearing the boiled eggs and tea with which it is my custom to break my fast . * * * How long the greater tragedies of life lie hidden beneath the careless surface ! From a chance remark of this excellent Martha 's , I have but now discovered , after many years ' experience of it , that what I have always fondly supposed to be tea , she , who makes it , equally fondly supposes to be coffee . * * * There is only one other thing worth mentioning about Martha , and I will mention it . For very many years , as she is in the habit of telling me once a week , she has been walking out with a policeman . This has suggested to me a quaint thought , that to marry a policeman is the cheapest and most effective way of insuring against burglary , but otherwise , I confess , I have shown and felt but little interest in this _affaire de coeur_ . * * * A letter lay on the table beside my plate . It was addressed to me . I picked it up and , holding the envelope in my left hand , with the first finger of my right hand I tore open the flap . I then withdrew the enclosure and , standing with my back to the window so that the light fell on to the written sheet , I read it . * * * It was from my sister , my little sister Clare , and it told me that she was engaged to be married . My sister , my little sister Clare , engaged to be married , and to a partner in a firm of publishers of all people ! Here was news indeed ! I own that Clare 's publisher interested me very much more than Martha 's policeman . * * * I remember nothing more until I looked up a few moments later to see a robin once again upon my window-ledge . I would not swear that it was the same bird , but , feeling that one robin was as good as another , I told it all about Clare 's publisher and what this might mean to all of us . * * * Some days later I came down to breakfast , to find another letter lying on the table beside my plate . This letter also was addressed to me . Having gone through much the same process as that used with regard to my earlier correspondence , I discovered that this was from Clare 's _fianc_ . He thanked me for my very kind congratulations of the 13th ultimo , and went on to say that , with regard to the latter part of my letter , he was not quite sure exactly what an idyll might be , and so my interesting description of my embryo book conveyed little to him . Even so , he went on , he would have been honoured to publish any book written by any relative of his dear Clare , but that he dealt , to be candid , exclusively in legal text-books . * * * To Martha , entering at this moment , I confessed that there was at least this to be said for her and her man , that they had never concealed their connection with that odious thing , the Law . * * * Later , I read an extract from my manuscript aloud to the robin . He wore an air of abstraction and I could see that his thoughts were running on other matters more immediately concerned with his own interests . * * * To me the robin is a peculiarly human bird . * * * * * BLANCHE 'S LETTERS . _REVUES_ AND THINGS . _Park Lane._ _January 31st._ DEAREST DAPHNE , -- I 've been putting in quite a pleasant little time down at Much Gaddington with Bosh and Wee-Wee . Theatricals were the order of the night , and the best thing we did was a _revue_ written for us by the Rector of Much Gaddington , who 's a perfectly sweet man and immensely clever . It's a better _revue_ than _any_ of those at the theatres , and as that dreadful Censor had , of course , nothing to do with it the dear rector could make it as snappy as he liked . Wee-Wee and I were two `` plume girls , '' Sal and Nan , in aprons , you know , and feathers and boots stitched with white ; and our duet , `` Biff along , Old Sport ! '' with a pavement dance between the verses , fairly brought down the house . The rector himself was _impayable_ in his songs , `` Wink to me only , '' and `` Tango -- Tangoing -- Tangone ! '' But the outstanding feature of the whole affair was certainly Dick Flummery , who introduced his new and sensational _Danse trois Jambes_ , entirely his own invention ! What Dick does n't know about dancing is n't worth knowing , and he says all the steps that _can_ be done with two legs have _been_ done , and for _anything_ really novel another leg must be added . So he 's had a clockwork leg made , and he winds it up before beginning and makes its movements blend in with the steps of his _real_ legs , and the effect is simply enormous ! People wrote to Wee-Wee from far and near begging to come and see `` Hold Tight , Please ! '' -- that 's

In this market-oriented economy , private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions , and government buys needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace . US business firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant , lay off surplus workers , and develop new products . At the same time , they face higher barriers to entry in their rivals ' home markets than the barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets . In all economic sectors , US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances , especially in computers , and medical , aerospace , and military equipment , although their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II . The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a `` two-tier labor market '' in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and , more and more , fail to get pay raises , health insurance coverage , and other benefits . The years 1994-96 witnessed moderate gains in real output , low inflation rates , and a drop in unemployment below 6 % . Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure , rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population , sizable budget and trade deficits , and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups . The outlook for 1997 is for continued moderate growth , low inflation , and about the same level of unemployment .

The `` Life '' Booklets ON THE OPEN ROAD THOUGHTS I MET ON THE HIGHWAY THE WINNING OF THE BEST THE GREATEST THING EVER KNOWN EVERY LIVING CREATURE CHARACTER-BUILDING THOUGHT POWER DODD , MEAD & COMPANY NEW YORK * * * * * Thoughts are forces -- like builds like and like attracts like . Thoughts of strength both build strength from within and attract it from without . Thoughts of weakness actualize weakness from within and attract it from without . Courage begets strength , fear begets weakness . And so courage begets success , fear begets failure . * * * * * Any way the old world goes Happy be the weather ! With the red thorn or the rose Singin ' all together ! Do n't you see that sky o ' blue ! Good Lord painted it for you Reap the daisies in the dew Singin ' all together ! Springtime sweet , an ' frosty fall Happy be the weather ! Earth has gardens for us all , Goin ' on together . Sweet the labor in the light , To the harvest 's gold and white -- Till the toilers say `` Good night , '' Singin ' all together ! * * * * * There is no quality that exerts more good , is of greater service to all mankind during the course of the ordinary life , than the mind and the heart that goes out in an all-embracing love for all , that is the generator and the circulator of a genuine , hearty , wholesome sympathy and courage and good cheer , that is not disturbed or upset by the passing occurrence little or great , but that is serene , tranquil , and conquering to the end , that is looking for the best , that is finding the best , and that is inspiring the best in all . There is moreover , no quality that when genuine brings such rich returns to its possessor by virtue of the thoughts and the feelings that it inspires and calls forth from others and that come back laden with their peaceful , stimulating , healthful influences for you . * * * * * Out of the night that covers me , Black as the Pit from pole to pole , I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul . In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud . Under the bludgeoning of chance My head is bloody , but unbowed . Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade , And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me , unafraid . It matters not how strait the gate How charged with punishment the scroll , I am the master of my fate ; I am the captain of my soul . _William Earnest Henley_ * * * * * Thought is the great builder in human life : it is the determining factor . Continually think thoughts that are good , and your life will show forth in goodness , and your body in health and beauty . Continually think evil thoughts , and your life will show forth in evil , and your body in weakness and repulsiveness . Think thoughts of love , and you will love and will be loved . Think thoughts of hatred , and you will hate and will be hated . Each follows its kind . * * * * * Every day is a fresh beginning , Every morning is the world made new ; You who are weary of sorrow and sinning , Here is a beautiful hope for you , A hope for me and a hope for you . All the past things are past and over , The tasks are done , and the tears are shed . Yesterday 's errors let yesterday cover ; Yesterday 's wounds , which smarted and bled , Are healed with the healing which night has shed . Every day is a fresh beginning , Listen , my soul , to the glad refrain , And , spite of old sorrow and older sinning , And puzzles forecasted , and possible pain , Take heart with the day and begin again . * * * * * Each morning is a fresh beginning . We are , as it were , just beginning life . We have it _entirely_ in our own hands . And when the morning with its fresh beginning comes , all yesterdays should be yesterdays , with which we have nothing to do . Sufficient is it to know that the way we lived our yesterday has determined for us our today . And , again , when the morning with its fresh beginning comes , all tomorrows should be tomorrows , with which we have nothing to do . Sufficient to know that the way we live our today determines our tomorrow . Simply the first hour of this new day , with all its richness and glory , with all its sublime and eternity-determining possibilities , and each succeeding hour as it comes , but _not before_ it comes -- this is the secret of character building . This simple method will bring any one to the realization of the highest life that can be even conceived of , and there is nothing in this connection that can be conceived of that can not be realized somehow , somewhen , somewhere . * * * * * The poem hangs on the berry-bush When comes the poet 's eye , And the whole street is a masquerade When Shakespeare passes by . * * * * * This same Shakespeare , whose mere passing causes all this commotion , is the one who put into the mouth of one of his creations the words : `` The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings . '' And again he gave us a great truth when he said : `` Our doubts are traitors , And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt . '' There is probably no agent that brings us more undesirable conditions than fear . We should live in fear of nothing , nor will we when we come fully to know ourselves . An old French proverb runs : `` Some of your griefs you have cured , And the sharpest you still have survived ; But what torments of pain you endured From evils that never arrived . '' Fear and lack of faith go hand in hand . The one is born of the other . Tell me how much one is given to fear , and I will tell you how much he lacks in faith . Fear is a most expensive guest to entertain , the same as worry is : so expensive are they that no one can afford to entertain them . We invite what we fear , the same as , by a different attitude of mind , we invite and attract the influences and conditions we desire . * * * * * To remain in nature always sweet and simple and humble , and therefore strong . `` Whatever the weather may be , '' says he , `` Whatever the weather may be , It 's the songs ye sing , an ' the smiles ye wear , That 's a-makin ' the sun shine everywhere . '' _James Whitcomb Riley_ * * * * * Sweetness of nature , simplicity in manners and conduct , humility without self-abasement , give the truly kingly quality to men , the queenly to women , the winning to children , whatever the rank or the station may be . The life dominated by this characteristic , or rather these closely allied characteristics , is a natural well-spring of joy to itself and sheds a continual benediction upon all who come within the scope of its influence . It makes for a life of great beauty in itself , and it imparts courage and hope and buoyancy to all others . * * * * * There is no thing we can not overcome ; Say not thy evil instinct is inherited , Or that some trait inborn makes thy whole life forlorn ; And calls down punishment that is not merited . Back of thy parents and grandparents lies The Great Eternal Will ! That too is thine Inheritance , -- strong , beautiful , divine , Sure lever of success for one who tries . Earth has no claim the soul can not contest ; Know thyself part of the Eternal Source ; Naught can stand before thy spirit 's force : The soul 's Divine Inheritance is best . * * * * * Thought is at the bottom of all progress or retrogression , of all success or failure , of all that is desirable or undesirable in human life . The type of thought we entertain both creates and draws conditions that crystallize about it , conditions exactly the same in nature as is the thought that gives them form . Thoughts are forces , and each creates of its kind , whether we realize it or not . The great law of the drawing power of the mind , which says that like creates like , and that like attracts like , is continually working in every human life , for it is one of the great immutable laws of the universe . For one to take time to see clearly the things one would attain to , and then to hold that ideal steadily and continually before his mind , never allowing faith -- his positive thought-forces -- to give way to or to be neutralized by doubts and fears , and then to set about doing each day what his hands find to do , never complaining , but spending the time that he would otherwise spend in complaint in focusing his thought-forces upon the ideal that his mind has built , will sooner or later bring about the full materialization of that for which he sets out . * * * * * Beauty seen is never lost , God 's colors all are fast ; The glory of this sunset heaven Into my soul has passed , -- A sense of gladness unconfined To mortal , date or clime ; As the soul liveth , it shall live Beyond the years of time . Beside the mystic asphodels Shall bloom the home-born flowers , And new horizons flush and glow With sunset hues of ours . _Whittier_ * * * * * Would you remain always young , and would you carry all the joyousness and buoyancy of youth into your maturer years ? Then have care concerning but one thing , -- how you live in your thought world . It was the inspired one , Gautama , the Buddha , who said , -- '' The mind is everything ; what you think you become . '' And the same thing had Ruskin in mind when he said , -- '' Make yourselves nests of pleasant thoughts . None of us as yet know , for none of us have been taught in early youth , what fairy palaces we may build of beautiful thought -- _proof against all adversity_ . '' And would you have in your body all the elasticity , all the strength , all the beauty of your younger years ? Then live these in your mind , making no room for unclean thought , and you will externalize them in your body . In the degree that you keep young in thought will you remain young in body . And you will find that your body will in turn aid your mind , for body helps mind the same as mind helps body . * * * * * There is a sacred Something on all ways -- Something that watches through the Universe ; One that remembers , reckons and repays , Giving us love for love , and curse for curse . _Edwin Markham_ * * * * * The power of every life , the very life itself , is determined by what it relates itself to . God is immanent as well as transcendent . He is creating , working , ruling in the universe today , in your life and in mine , just as much as He ever has been . We are too apt to regard Him after the manner of an absentee landlord , one who has set in operation the forces of this great universe , and then taken Himself away . In the degree , however , that we recognize Him as immanent as well as transcendent , are we able to partake of His life and power . For in the degree that we recognize Him as the Infinite Spirit of Life and Power that is today , at this very moment , working and manifesting in and through all , and then , in the degree that we come into the realization of our oneness with this life , do we become partakers of , and so do we actualize in ourselves the qualities of his life . In the degree that we open ourselves to the inflowing tide of this immanent and transcendent life , do we make ourselves channels through which the Infinite Intelligence and Power can work . * * * * * The robber is robbed by his riches ; The tyrant is dragged by his chain ; The schemer is snared by his cunning , The slayer lies dead by the slain . _Edwin Markham_ * * * * * This is the law of prosperity : When apparent adversity comes , be not cast down by it , but make the best of it , and always look forward for better things , for conditions more prosperous . To hold yourself in this attitude of mind is to set into operation subtle , silent , and irresistible forces that sooner or later will actualize in material form that which is today merely an idea . But ideas have occult power , and ideas , when rightly planted and rightly tended , are the seeds that actualize material conditions . Never give a moment to complaint , but utilize the time that would otherwise be spent in this way in looking forward and actualizing the conditions you desire . Suggest prosperity to yourself . See yourself in a prosperous condition . Affirm that you will before long be in a prosperous condition . Affirm it calmly and quietly , but strongly and confidently . Believe it , believe it absolutely . Expect it , -- keep it continually watered with expectation . You thus make yourself a magnet to attract the things that you desire . Do n't be afraid to suggest . * * * * * They might not need me -- yet they might , I 'll let my heart be just in sight . A smile so small as mine might be Precisely their necessity . _Emily Dickinson_ * * * * * The grander natures and the more thoughtful are always looking for and in conversation dwelling on the better things in others . It is the rule with but few , if any exceptions , that the more noble and worthy and thoughtful the nature , the more it is continually looking for the best there is to be found in every life . Instead of judging or condemning , or acquiring the habit that eventually leads to this , it is looking more closely to and giving its time to living more worthily itself . It is in this way continually unfolding and expanding in beauty and in power ; it is finding an ever-increasing happiness by the admiration and the love that such a life is always , even though all unconsciously , calling to itself from all sources . It is the life that pays by many fold . * * * * * We just shake hands at meeting With many that come nigh We nod the head in greeting To many that go by -- But welcome through the gateway Our few old friends and true ; Then hearts leap up , and straightway There 's open house for you . Old friends . There 's open house for you ! _Gerald Massey_ * * * * * Many times the struggles are greater than we can ever know . We need more gentleness and sympathy and compassion in our common human life . Then we will neither blame nor condemn . Instead of blaming or condemning we will sympathize . `` Comfort one another . For the way is often dreary And

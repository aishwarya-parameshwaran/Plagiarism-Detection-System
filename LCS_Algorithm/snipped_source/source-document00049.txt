The matter has been written or chosen with a view to interest and instruct , to cultivate a taste for the best literature , to build up a strong moral character and to imbue our children with an intelligent love of Faith and Country . The methods are those approved by the most experienced and progressive teachers of reading in Europe and America . These Readers have also been specially designed to elicit thought and facilitate literary composition . In furtherance of this idea , class talks , word study , the structure of sentences , drills on certain correct forms of expression , the proper arrangement of ideas , explanation of phrases and literary expressions , oral and written reproductions of narrations and descriptions , and exercises in original composition , all receive the attention which their importance demands . Thus will the pupils , while learning to read and from their earliest years , acquire that readiness in grasping the thoughts of others and that fluency in expressing their own , which are so essential to a good English education . In teaching the art of Reading as well as that of Composition , the principle of order should in a great measure determine the value of the methods to be employed . In the acquisition of knowledge , the child instinctively follows the order of nature . This order is first , _observation_ ; second , _thought_ ; third , _expression_ . It becomes the duty of the teacher , consequently , to lead the child to observe _accurately_ , to think _clearly_ , and to express his thoughts _correctly_ . And text-books are useful only in so far as they supply the teacher with the material and the system best calculated to accomplish such results . It is therefore hoped that the present new series of Readers , having been planned in accordance with the principle just enunciated , will prove a valuable adjunct in our Catholic schools . * * * * * _3_ INTRODUCTION In this Fifth Reader of the De La Salle Series the plan of the preceding numbers has been continued . The pupil has now mastered the mechanical difficulties of learning to read , and has acquired a fairly good working vocabulary . Hence he is prepared to read intelligently and with some degree of fluency and pleasure . Now is the time to lead him to acquire a taste for good reading . The selections have been drawn mainly from authors whose writings are distinguished for their moral and literary value , and whose style is sure to excite a lasting interest . In addition to giving the pupil practice in reading and forming a basis for oral and written composition work , these selections will raise his ideas of right living , will quicken his imagination , will give him his first knowledge of many things , stimulate his powers of observation , enlarge his vocabulary , and correct and refine his mode of expression . A wholesome reading habit , so important to-day , will thus be easily , pleasantly and unconsciously formed . The following are some of the features of the book : GUIDE TO PRONUNCIATION. -- This Guide is to be referred to again and again , and the diacritical marks carefully taught . Instruction in the vowel sounds is an excellent drill in articulation , while a knowledge of the diacritical marks enables the pupil to master these sounds for himself when consulting the dictionary . VARIETY OF MATTER. -- In the volume will be found the best sentiments of the best writers . The pupil will find fables , nature studies , tales of travel and adventure , brave deeds from history and fiction , stories of loyalty and heroism , examples of sublime Christian self-sacrifice , and selections that teach industry , contentment , respect for authority , reverence for all things sacred , attachment to home , and fidelity to faith and Country . LANGUAGE STUDY. -- If reading is to hold its proper place in the class room , the teaching of it must not be confined to the mere reading of the text . In its truest sense , reading is far more comprehensive . The teacher will question the pupil on what he has read , point out to him the beauties of thought and language , find out what hold the reading has taken upon his memory , how it has aroused his imagination , assisted his judgment , directed his will , and contributed to his fund of general information . To assist in this most important work is the object aimed at in the matter given for Language Study . Such study will also give fuller powers of interpretation and corresponding appreciation of the selection considered simply as literature . RECITATIONS. -- There are some selections marked for recitation . The public recitation of these extracts will banish awkwardness of manner , beget self-confidence , and lay the foundation for subsequent elocutionary work . Besides , experience teaches that a single poem or address based upon some heroic or historic event , recited before a class or a school , will often do more to build up a noble character and foster a love of history , than a full term of instruction by question and answer . POETRY. -- The numerous poetic selections , some of which are partly analyzed by way of suggestion , will create a love for the highest and purest forms of literature , will broaden the field of knowledge , and emphasize the teachings of some of the prose selections . Many of them have been written by American authors . Every American boy and girl should be acquainted with the works of poets who have done so much for the development of American literature and nationality . MEMORY GEMS. -- '' The memorizing of choice bits of prose and poetry enriches the vocabulary of the pupils , adorns their memory , suggests delicate and noble thoughts , and puts them in possession of sentences of the best construction . The recitation of these expressive texts accustoms the children to speak with ease , grace and elegance . '' ( `` Elements of Practical Pedagogy . '' ) BIOGRAPHIES. -- Young children enjoy literature for its own sake , and take little interest in the personality of the writer ; but as they grow older , pleasure in the work of an author arouses an interest in the writer himself . Brief biographical sketches are given at the close of the volume as helps in the study of the authors from whom selections are drawn , and to induce the pupils to read further . * * * * * _4_ SUGGESTIONS WORD STUDY. -- The pupil should know how to spell and pronounce correctly all the words of the selection he is preparing to read . He should know their ordinary meanings and the special meanings they may have in the text . He should be able to write them correctly from dictation and to use them in sentences of his own . He should examine if they are primitive , derivative , or compound ; he should be able to name the prefixes and suffixes and show how the meanings of the original words are modified by their use . He should cultivate the habit of word mastery . What is read will not otherwise be understood . Without it there can be no good reading , speaking or writing . EXPRESSIVE READING. -- There should be constant drill to secure correct pronunciation , distinct articulation , proper emphasis , and an agreeable tone of voice , without which there can be no expressive reading . This is a difficult task , and will take much time , trouble and practice ; but it has far-reaching results . It enlarges the sympathy of the pupil and lays the foundation for a genuine love of literature . Do not , then , let the reading lesson drift into a dull and monotonous calling of words . On the contrary , let it be intelligent , spirited , enthusiastic . Emotion comes largely from the imagination . The pupil himself must be taught not only to feel what he reads , but to make its meaning clear to others . It is important that children be taught to acquire thought through the ear . CONCERT READING. -- Reading in concert is generally of little value , and the time given to it ill-spent . It does not aid the children in getting thought , or in expressing it fluently . As an exercise in teaching reading it is ineffective and often positively harmful . A concert recitation to which special training has been given partakes of the nature of a hymn or a song , and then becomes an element of value . If occasionally there must be concert reading in the class room , it should always be preceded by individual mastery of the selection . POEMS. -- In the first lesson , a poem , like a picture , should be presented as a whole , and never dissected . The teacher should first read it through , not stopping for note or comment . He should then read it again , part by part , stopping , for question , explanation and discussion . Lastly , the whole poem , should be read with suitable emotion , so that the final impression may be made by the author 's own words . It is important that the pupil get the message which the author intended to give . In teaching a descriptive poem , make the pictures as vivid as possible , and thus awaken the imagination . In dealing with a narrative poem , the sequence of events must first be made clear . When this is done , the aim should be to give fuller meaning to the story by bringing out clearly the causes , motives and results of acts . All this will take time . Be it so . One poem well read , well studied , is worth more than a volume carelessly read over . In reading poetry , be careful that the pupils , while giving the rhythm of the lines , do not fall into the singsong tone so common and so disagreeable . EXPLANATIONS. -- Explanations should accompany every reading lesson , without which there can be no serious teaching of the vernacular . By their means the teacher enters into communication with his pupils ; he gets them to speak , he corrects their errors , trains their reason , and forms their taste . It has been said that a teacher able to explain selections in prose and poetry `` holds his class in the hollow of his hand . '' The teacher should insist that the pupil express himself clearly and correctly , not only during the reading lesson , but on every subject he has occasion to deal with , either orally or in writing , throughout the day 's recitations . REVIEWS. -- As the memory of children , though prompt , is weak , frequent reviews should be held . They are necessary for the backward pupils and advantageous for the others . Have an informal talk with the children on what they have read , what they have learned , what they have liked , and what has interested them . Some important parts of the prose and poetry previously studied might , during this exercise , be re-read with profit . COMPOSITION. -- Continue oral and written composition . The correct use of written language is best taught by selecting for compositions subject-matter that deeply interests the children . If persevered in , this will secure a good , strong , idiomatic use of English . If the words of a selection that has been studied appear now and then in the children 's conversation or writing , it should be a matter for praise ; for this means that new words have been added to their vocabulary , and that the children have a new conception of beauty of thought and speech . See that all written work be done neatly and legibly . Slovenly or careless habits should never be allowed in any written work . MEMORY GEMS. -- Do not lose sight of the memory gems . Familiarize the pupil with them . Their value to the child lies more in future good resulting from them than in present good . These treasures of thought will live in the memory and influence the daily lives of the children who learn them by heart . THE DICTIONARY. -- The use of the dictionary is a necessary part of education . It is a powerful aid in self-education . Its use will double the value of study in connection with reading and language . Every Grammar School , High School and College should be supplied with several copies of a good unabridged dictionary , and every pupil taught how to consult it , and encouraged to do so . The dictionary should be the book of first and last and constant resort . USE OF THE LIBRARY. -- The teacher should endeavor to create an interest in those books from which the selections
